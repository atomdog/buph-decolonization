Recently, TMPRSS2 was identified as the proteinaceous receptor for HCoV-HKU1 alongside sialoglycan as a glycan receptor. However, the underlying mechanisms for viral entry remain unknown. Here, we investigated the HCoV-HKU1C spike in the inactive, glycan-activated, and functionally anchored states, revealing that sialoglycan binding induces a conformational change of the NTD and promotes the neighboring RBD of the spike to open for TMPRSS2 recognition, exhibiting a synergistic mechanism for the entry of HCoV-HKU1. The RBD of HCoV-HKU1 features an insertion subdomain that recognizes TMPRSS2 through three previously undiscovered interfaces. Furthermore, structural investigation of HCoV-HKU1A in combination with mutagenesis and binding assays confirms a conserved receptor recognition pattern adopted by HCoV-HKU1. These studies advance our understanding of the complex viral-host interactions during entry, laying the groundwork for developing new therapeutics against coronavirus-associated diseases.

The molecular basis of HKU1 binding to TMPRSS2 and determinants of host receptor tropism remain elusive. We designed an active human TMPRSS2 construct enabling high-yield recombinant production in human cells of this key therapeutic target. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the HKU1 RBD bound to human TMPRSS2, providing a blueprint of the interactions supporting viral entry and explaining the specificity for TMPRSS2 among orthologous proteases. We identified TMPRSS2 orthologs from five mammalian orders promoting HKU1 S-mediated entry into cells along with key residues governing host receptor usage. Our data show that the TMPRSS2 binding motif is a site of vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies and suggest that HKU1 uses S conformational masking and glycan shielding to balance immune evasion and receptor engagement.

Here, we identify dexamethasone treatment-induced cellular and molecular changes associated with improved survival in COVID-19 patients. We observed a reversal of transcriptional hallmark signatures in monocytes associated with severe COVID-19 and the induction of a monocyte substate characterized by the expression of glucocorticoid-response genes. These molecular responses to dexamethasone were detected in circulating and pulmonary monocytes, and they were directly linked to survival. Monocyte single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived signatures were enriched in whole blood transcriptomes of patients with fatal outcome in two independent cohorts, highlighting the potential for identifying non-responders refractory to dexamethasone. Our findings link the effects of dexamethasone to specific immunomodulation and reversal of monocyte dysregulation, and they highlight the potential of single-cell omics for monitoring in vivo target engagement of immunomodulatory drugs and for patient stratification for precision medicine approaches.

TMPRSS2 is synthesized as a zymogen that undergoes autolytic activation to process its substrates. Several respiratory viruses, in particular coronaviruses, use TMPRSS2 for proteolytic priming of their surface spike protein to drive membrane fusion upon receptor binding. We describe the crystal structure of the HKU1-CoV receptor binding domain in complex with TMPRSS2, showing that it recognizes residues lining the catalytic groove. Combined mutagenesis of interface residues and comparison across species highlight positions 417 and 469 as determinants of HKU1-CoV host tropism. The structure of a receptor-blocking nanobody in complex with zymogen or activated TMPRSS2 further provides the structural basis of TMPRSS2 activating conformational change, which alters loops recognized by HKU1-CoV and dramatically increases binding affinity.

In C. elegans, neurons experiencing mitochondrial stress elicit an inter-tissue signaling pathway through the release of mitokine signals, such as serotonin or the Wnt ligand EGL-20, which activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) in the periphery to promote organismal health and lifespan. We find that germline mitochondria play a surprising role in neuron-to-periphery UPRMT signaling. Specifically, we find that germline mitochondria signal downstream of neuronal mitokines, Wnt and serotonin, and upstream of lipid metabolic pathways in the periphery to regulate UPRMT activation. We also find that the germline tissue itself is essential for UPRMT signaling. We propose that the germline has a central signaling role in coordinating mitochondrial stress responses across tissues, and germline mitochondria play a defining role in this coordination because of their inherent roles in germline integrity and inter-tissue signaling.

Here, we identified microdeletions on chromosome Xq23 disrupting the brain-expressed transient receptor potential (TRP) channel 5 (TRPC5). This family of channels detects sensory stimuli and converts them into electrical signals interpretable by the brain. Male TRPC5 deletion carriers exhibited food seeking, obesity, anxiety, and autism, which were recapitulated in knockin male mice harboring a human loss-of-function TRPC5 mutation. Women carrying TRPC5 deletions had severe postpartum depression. As mothers, female knockin mice exhibited anhedonia and depression-like behavior with impaired care of offspring. Deletion of Trpc5 from oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus caused obesity in both sexes and postpartum depressive behavior in females, while Trpc5 overexpression in oxytocin neurons in knock-in mice reversed these phenotypes. We demonstrate that TRPC5 plays a pivotal role in mediating innate human behaviors fundamental to survival, including food seeking and maternal care.

Although these species have avoided the immediate extinction threat, their long-term viability remains precarious due to the potential genetic consequences of population declines, which are poorly understood on a timescale beyond a few generations. Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) became isolated on Wrangel Island around 10,000 years ago and persisted for over 200 generations before becoming extinct around 4,000 years ago. To study the evolutionary processes leading up to the mammoths#QUOTE# extinction, we analyzed 21 Siberian woolly mammoth genomes. Our results show that the population recovered quickly from a severe bottleneck and remained demographically stable during the ensuing six millennia. We find that mildly deleterious mutations gradually accumulated, whereas highly deleterious mutations were purged, suggesting ongoing inbreeding depression that lasted for hundreds of generations. The time-lag between demographic and genetic recovery has wide-ranging implications for conservation management of recently bottlenecked populations.

Functioning as a signaling hub within the cell, mitochondria integrate information from various intracellular compartments to regulate cellular signaling and metabolism. Multiple studies have shown that mitochondria may respond to various extracellular signaling events. However, it is less clear how changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) can impact mitochondrial homeostasis to regulate animal physiology. We find that ECM remodeling alters mitochondrial homeostasis in an evolutionarily conserved manner. Mechanistically, ECM remodeling triggers a TGF-\u03b2 response to induce mitochondrial fission and the unfolded protein response of the mitochondria (UPRMT). At the organismal level, ECM remodeling promotes defense of animals against pathogens through enhanced mitochondrial stress responses. We postulate that this ECM-mitochondria crosstalk represents an ancient immune pathway, which detects infection- or mechanical-stress-induced ECM damage, thereby initiating adaptive mitochondria-based immune and metabolic responses.

One such secreted factor, the complement protein C1q, contributes to complement-mediated synapse elimination in both developmental and disease models, yet brain C1q protein levels increase significantly throughout aging. Here, we report that C1q interacts with neuronal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in an age-dependent manner. Purified C1q protein undergoes RNA-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, and the interaction of C1q with neuronal RNP complexes in vivo is dependent on RNA and endocytosis. Mice lacking C1q have age-specific alterations in neuronal protein synthesis in vivo and impaired fear memory extinction. Together, our findings reveal a biophysical property of C1q that underlies RNA- and age-dependent neuronal interactions and demonstrate a role of C1q in critical intracellular neuronal processes.

Here, we show in yeast that covalent modification with the ubiquitin-like modifier Urm1 promotes the phase separation of a wide range of proteins. We find that the drop in cellular pH induced by stress triggers Urm1 self-association and its interaction with both target proteins and the Urm1-conjugating enzyme Uba4. Urmylation of stress-sensitive proteins promotes their deposition into stress granules and nuclear condensates. Yeast cells lacking Urm1 exhibit condensate defects that manifest in reduced stress resilience.

Antibodies targeting IL-23 and IL-17 have shown clinical efficacy but are limited by high costs, safety risks, lack of sustained efficacy, and poor patient convenience as they require parenteral administration. Here, we present designed miniproteins inhibiting IL-23R and IL-17 with antibody-like, low picomolar affinities at a fraction of the molecular size. The minibinders potently block cell signaling in vitro and are extremely stable, enabling oral administration and low-cost manufacturing. The orally administered IL-23R minibinder shows efficacy better than a clinical anti-IL-23 antibody in mouse colitis and has a favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution profile in rats. This work demonstrates that orally administered de novo-designed minibinders can reach a therapeutic target past the gut epithelial barrier.

We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites.

During this time, the embryo maintains a window of plasticity and can redirect its cellular fate when challenged experimentally. In this context, we found that the PrE alone was sufficient to regenerate a complete blastocyst and continue post-implantation development. We identify an in vitro population similar to the early PrE in vivo that exhibits the same embryonic and extra-embryonic potency and can form complete stem cell-based embryo models, termed blastoids. Commitment in the PrE is suppressed by JAK/STAT signaling, collaborating with OCT4 and the sustained expression of a subset of pluripotency-related transcription factors that safeguard an enhancer landscape permissive for multi-lineage differentiation.

Here, we report Open-ST, a sequencing-based, open-source experimental and computational resource to address these challenges and to study the molecular organization of tissues in 2D and 3D. In mouse brain, Open-ST captured transcripts at subcellular resolution and reconstructed cell types. In primary head-and-neck tumors and patient-matched healthy/metastatic lymph nodes, Open-ST captured the diversity of immune, stromal, and tumor populations in space, validated by imaging-based ST. Distinct cell states were organized around cell-cell communication hotspots in the tumor but not the metastasis. Strikingly, the 3D reconstruction and multimodal analysis of the metastatic lymph node revealed spatially contiguous structures not visible in 2D and potential biomarkers precisely at the 3D tumor/lymph node boundary.

Though 70% of human lifespan variance remains unexplained by heritable factors, little is known about the intrinsic sources of physiologic heterogeneity in aging. To understand how complex physiologic networks generate lifespan variation, new methods are needed. Here, we present Asynch-seq, an approach that uses gene-expression heterogeneity within isogenic populations to study the processes generating lifespan variation. By collecting thousands of single-individual transcriptomes, we capture the Caenorhabditis elegans #QUOTE#pan-transcriptome#QUOTE#-a highly resolved atlas of non-genetic variation. We use our atlas to guide a large-scale perturbation screen that identifies the decoupling of total mRNA content between germline and soma as the largest source of physiologic heterogeneity in aging, driven by pleiotropic genes whose knockdown dramatically reduces lifespan variance. Our work demonstrates how systematic mapping of physiologic heterogeneity can be applied to reduce inter-individual disparities in aging.

Besides its traditional function in telomere synthesis, TERT acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of genes pivotal in aging and age-associated diseases. Here, we report the identification of a TERT activator compound (TAC) that upregulates TERT transcription via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade. In primary human cells and naturally aged mice, TAC-induced elevation of TERT levels promotes telomere synthesis, blunts tissue aging hallmarks with reduced cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silences p16INK4a expression via upregulation of DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC alleviates neuroinflammation, increases neurotrophic factors, stimulates adult neurogenesis, and preserves cognitive function without evident toxicity, including cancer risk. Together, these findings underscore TERT#QUOTE#s critical role in aging processes and provide preclinical proof of concept for physiological TERT activation as a strategy to mitigate multiple aging hallmarks and associated pathologies.

Progress in the field has been accelerated by advances in genomics, imaging, engineering, and computational biology and by emerging model systems ranging from tardigrades to organoids. We summarize how revolutionary technologies have led to remarkable progress in understanding animal development. We describe how classic questions in gene regulation, pattern formation, morphogenesis, organogenesis, and stem cell biology are being revisited.

Thirty-seven and forty-five MG species (MGSs) were associated with resistance (SIG1) and response (SIG2) to ICIs, respectively.

Finally, this TOPOSCORE was translated into a 21-bacterial probe set-based qPCR scoring that was validated in a prospective cohort of NSCLC patients as well as in colorectal and melanoma patients.

Yet, complex patterns also emerge in adults, suggesting that the capacity for spontaneous self-organization is a ubiquitous property of biological tissues. We review current knowledge on the principles and mechanisms of self-organized patterning in embryonic tissues and explore how these principles and mechanisms apply to adult tissues that exhibit features of patterning. We discuss how and why spontaneous pattern generation is integral to homeostasis and healing of tissues, illustrating it with examples from regenerative biology. We examine how aberrant self-organization underlies diverse pathological states, including inflammatory skin disorders and tumors. Lastly, we posit that based on such blueprints, targeted engineering of pattern-driving molecular circuits can be leveraged for synthetic biology and the generation of organoids with intricate patterns."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Cell Editorial team", "authorLink": "/?term=Cell+Editorial+team%5BCorporate+Author%5D", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}], "articleTitle": "Wonder and awe: Developmental biology inspires", "journalTitle": "Cell", "journalLink": "/?term=%22Cell%22%5Bjour%5D&sort=date&sort_order=desc", "cit": "2024 Jun 20;187(13):3163-3164.", "doi": "doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2024.05.042.", "secondaryDate": null, "grants": [], "abstract": "Abstract                          Awe-inspiring developmental biology is all around us.

Our study analyzed co-signaling receptors during hepatocellular priming and traced the trajectory and fate of dysfunctional HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Early on, these cells upregulate PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, OX40, 4-1BB, and ICOS. While blocking co-inhibitory receptors had minimal effect, activating 4-1BB and OX40 converted them into antiviral effectors. Prolonged stimulation led to a self-renewing, long-lived, heterogeneous population with a unique transcriptional profile. This includes dysfunctional progenitor/stem-like (TSL) cells and two distinct dysfunctional tissue-resident memory (TRM) populations. While 4-1BB expression is ubiquitously maintained, OX40 expression is limited to TSL. In chronic settings, only 4-1BB stimulation conferred antiviral activity. In HBeAg+ chronic patients, 4-1BB activation showed the highest potential to rejuvenate dysfunctional CD8+ T cells. Targeting all dysfunctional T cells, rather than only stem-like precursors, holds promise for treating chronic HBV infection.

We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate transgenic locusts expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages. Mechanistically, this unconventional spatial olfactory code reflects the locust-specific and multiplexed glomerular innervation pattern of the antennal lobe.

The >66,000 rove beetle species (Staphylinidae) form the largest metazoan family. Combining genomic and cell type transcriptomic insights spanning the largest clade, Aleocharinae, we retrace evolution of two cell types comprising a defensive gland-a putative catalyst behind staphylinid megadiversity. We identify molecular evolutionary steps leading to benzoquinone production by one cell type via a mechanism convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis by the second cell type of a solvent that weaponizes the total secretion. This cooperative system has been conserved since the Early Cretaceous as Aleocharinae radiated into tens of thousands of lineages. Reprogramming each cell type yielded biochemical novelties enabling ecological specialization-most dramatically in symbionts that infiltrate social insect colonies via host-manipulating secretions. Our findings uncover cell type evolutionary processes underlying the origin and evolvability of a beetle chemical innovation.

Here, we describe an iterative, comparative metabolomics pipeline to uncover microbial metabolic features in the complex setting of a host and apply it to investigate gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients. We find elevated levels of bacterially derived acetylated polyamines during BSI and discover the enzyme responsible for their production (SpeG). Blocking SpeG activity reduces bacterial proliferation and slows pathogenesis. Reduction of SpeG activity also enhances bacterial membrane permeability and increases intracellular antibiotic accumulation, allowing us to overcome AMR in culture and in vivo.

By dissecting the neuronal inflammatory stress response, we discovered that neurons in MS and its mouse model induce the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). However, activation of neuronal STING requires its detachment from the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a process triggered by glutamate excitotoxicity. This detachment initiates non-canonical STING signaling, which leads to autophagic degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), essential for neuronal redox homeostasis and thereby inducing ferroptosis. Both genetic and pharmacological interventions that target STING in neurons protect against inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.

Therefore, we screened for NLRC5#QUOTE#s role in response to infections, PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines. We identified that NLRC5 acts as an innate immune sensor to drive inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in response to specific ligands, including PAMP/heme and heme/cytokine combinations. NLRC5 interacted with NLRP12 and PANoptosome components to form a cell death complex, suggesting an NLR network forms similar to those in plants.

Pathogens binding to host extracellular proteins (the #QUOTE#exoproteome#QUOTE#) represents a crucial interface in the etiology of vector-borne disease. Here, we used bacterial selection to elucidate host-microbe interactions in high throughput (BASEHIT)-a technique enabling interrogation of microbial interactions with 3,324 human exoproteins-to profile the interactomes of 82 human-pathogen samples, including 30 strains of arthropod-borne pathogens and 8 strains of related non-vector-borne pathogens. The resulting atlas revealed 1,303 putative interactions, including hundreds of pairings with potential roles in pathogenesis, including cell invasion, tissue colonization, immune evasion, and host sensing. Subsequent functional investigations uncovered that Lyme disease spirochetes recognize epidermal growth factor as an environmental cue of transcriptional regulation and that conserved interactions between intracellular pathogens and thioredoxins facilitate cell invasion. In summary, this interactome atlas provides molecular-level insights into microbial pathogenesis and reveals potential host-directed targets for next-generation therapeutics.

In this study, we found that PD-1 and CTLA4-based cancer immunotherapies are unable to eradicate tumors in elderly mice. This defect in anti-tumor activity correlated with two known age-associated immune defects: diminished abundance of systemic naive CD8+ T cells and weak migratory activities of dendritic cells (DCs). We identified a vaccine adjuvant, referred to as a DC hyperactivator, which corrects DC migratory defects in the elderly. Vaccines containing tumor antigens and DC hyperactivators induced T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells with cytolytic activity that drive anti-tumor immunity in elderly mice. When administered early in life, DC hyperactivators were the only adjuvant identified that elicited anti-tumor CD4+ T cells that persisted into old age. These results raise the possibility of correcting age-associated immune defects through DC manipulation.

Replication initiation entails the assembly and activation of two CMG helicases (Cdc45\u22c5Mcm2-7\u22c5GINS) at each origin. This requires several replication firing factors (including TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON) whose exact roles are still under debate. How two helicases are correctly assembled and activated at each origin is a long-standing question. By visualizing the recruitment of GINS, Cdc45, TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON in real time, we uncovered that replication initiation is surprisingly dynamic. First, TopBP1 transiently binds to the origin and dissociates before the start of DNA synthesis. Second, two Cdc45 are recruited together, even though Cdc45 alone cannot dimerize. Next, two copies of DONSON and two GINS simultaneously arrive at the origin, completing the assembly of two CMG helicases. Finally, RecQL4 is recruited to the CMG\u22c5DONSON\u22c5DONSON\u22c5CMG complex and promotes DONSON dissociation and CMG activation via its ATPase activity.

Here, we show that anaerobic archaea encode diverse, active, and ancient lineages of [FeFe] hydrogenases through combining analysis of existing and new genomes with extensive biochemical experiments. [FeFe] hydrogenases are encoded by genomes of nine archaeal phyla and expressed by H2-producing Asgard archaeon cultures. We report an ultraminimal hydrogenase in DPANN archaea that binds the catalytic H-cluster and produces H2. Moreover, we identify and characterize remarkable hybrid complexes formed through the fusion of [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases in ten other archaeal orders. Phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling suggest a deep evolutionary history of hybrid hydrogenases. These findings reveal new metabolic adaptations of archaea, streamlined H2 catalysts for biotechnological development, and a surprisingly intertwined evolutionary history between the two major H2-metabolizing enzymes.

However, an unresolved challenge is the extensive cell death following transplantation. Here, we performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screen to enhance postmitotic dopamine neuron survival in vivo. We identified p53-mediated apoptotic cell death as a major contributor to dopamine neuron loss and uncovered a causal link of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in limiting cell survival. As a translationally relevant strategy to purify postmitotic dopamine neurons, we identified cell surface markers that enable purification without the need for genetic reporters. Combining cell sorting and treatment with adalimumab, a clinically approved TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, enabled efficient engraftment of postmitotic dopamine neurons with extensive reinnervation and functional recovery in a preclinical PD mouse model. Thus, transient TNF-\u03b1 inhibition presents a clinically relevant strategy to enhance survival and enable engraftment of postmitotic hPSC-derived dopamine neurons in PD.

By incorporating a de novo-designed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding module into these scaffolds, we generated a series of synthetic signaling ligands that exhibit potent valency- and geometry-dependent Ca2+ release and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. The high specificity of the designed agonists reveals distinct roles for two FGFR splice variants in driving arterial endothelium and perivascular cell fates during early vascular development.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial membrane remodeling and quality control to mtDNA copy number (CN) regulation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1) negatively regulates IMM fusion. Moreover, manipulation of mitochondrial fusion through the regulation of MTFP1 levels results in mtDNA CN modulation. Mechanistically, we found that MTFP1 inhibits mitochondrial fusion to isolate and exclude damaged IMM subdomains from the rest of the network. Subsequently, peripheral fission ensures their segregation into small MTFP1-enriched mitochondria (SMEM) that are targeted for degradation in an autophagic-dependent manner. Remarkably, MTFP1-dependent IMM quality control is essential for basal nucleoid recycling and therefore to maintain adequate mtDNA levels within the cell.

However, previous studies have indicated that Lgr5+ cells are dispensable for intestinal regeneration, leading to two major hypotheses: one favoring the presence of a quiescent reserve ISC and the other calling for differentiated cell plasticity. To investigate these possibilities, we studied crypt epithelial cells in an unbiased fashion via high-resolution single-cell profiling. These studies, combined with in vivo lineage tracing, show that Lgr5 is not a specific ISC marker and that stemness potential exists beyond the crypt base and resides in the isthmus region, where undifferentiated cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and regeneration following irradiation (IR) injury. Our results provide an alternative model of intestinal epithelial cell organization, suggesting that stemness potential is not restricted to CBC cells, and neither de-differentiation nor reserve ISC are drivers of intestinal regeneration.

Here, we identify a proliferative upper crypt population marked by Fgfbp1, in the location of putative TA cells, that is transcriptionally distinct from Lgr5+ cells. Using a kinetic reporter for time-resolved fate mapping and Fgfbp1-CreERT2 lineage tracing, we establish that Fgfbp1+ cells are multi-potent and give rise to Lgr5+ cells, consistent with their ISC function. Fgfbp1+ cells also sustain epithelial regeneration following Lgr5+ cell depletion. We demonstrate that FGFBP1, produced by the upper crypt cells, is an essential factor for crypt proliferation and epithelial homeostasis. Our findings support a model in which tissue regeneration originates from upper crypt Fgfbp1+ cells that generate progeny propagating bi-directionally along the crypt-villus axis and serve as a source of Lgr5+ cells in the crypt base.

Methods:                    In this open-label, blinded-outcome, randomised controlled trial, participants with high cardiovascular risk were enrolled from 116 hospitals or communities in China. We used minimised randomisation to assign participants to intensive treatment targeting standard office systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg or standard treatment targeting less than 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, revascularisation, hospitalisation for heart failure, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, assessed by the intention-to-treat principle. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04030234.              Findings:                    Between Sept 17, 2019, and July 13, 2020, 11 255 participants (4359 with diabetes and 3022 with previous stroke) were assigned to intensive treatment (n=5624) or standard treatment (n=5631). Their mean age was 64\u00b76 years (SD 7\u00b71). The mean systolic blood pressure throughout the follow-up (except the first 3 months of titration) was 119\u00b71 mm Hg (SD 11\u00b71) in the intensive treatment group and 134\u00b78 mm Hg (10\u00b75) in the standard treatment group. During a median of 3\u00b74 years of follow-up, the primary outcome event occurred in 547 (9\u00b77%) participants in the intensive treatment group and 623 (11\u00b71%) in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b788, 95% CI 0\u00b778-0\u00b799; p=0\u00b7028). There was no heterogeneity of effects by diabetes status, duration of diabetes, or history of stroke. Serious adverse events of syncope occurred more frequently in the intensive treatment group (24 [0\u00b74%] of 5624) than in standard treatment group (eight [0\u00b71%] of 5631; HR 3\u00b700, 95% CI 1\u00b735-6\u00b768). There was no significant between-group difference in the serious adverse events of hypotension, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, or acute kidney injury.              Interpretation:                    For hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, regardless of the status of diabetes or history of stroke, the treatment strategy of targeting systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with that of less than 140 mm Hg, prevents major vascular events, with minor excess risk.

However, the best endometrial preparation protocol for FET cycles is unclear. We compared natural and modified natural cycle strategies with an artificial cycle strategy for endometrial preparation before FET.              Methods:                    In this randomised, open-label study, we recruited ovulatory women aged 18-45 years at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, who were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to natural, modified natural, or artificial cycle endometrial preparation using a computer-generated random list and block randomisation. The trial was not masked due to the nature of the study interventions. In natural cycles, no oestrogen, progesterone, or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was used. In modified natural cycles, hCG was used to trigger ovulation. In artificial cycles, oral oestradiol valerate (8 mg/day from day 2-4 of menstruation) and vaginal progesterone (800 mg/day starting when endometrial thickness was \u22657 mm) were used. Embryos were vitrified, and then one or two day-3 embryos or one day-5 embryo were warmed and transferred under ultrasound guidance. If the first FET cycle was cancelled, subsequent cycles were performed with artificial endometrial preparation. The primary endpoint was livebirth after one FET. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04804020.              Findings:                    Between March 22, 2021, and March 14, 2023, 4779 women were screened and 1428 were randomly assigned (476 to each group). 99 first FET cycles were cancelled in each of the natural and modified cycle groups, versus none in the artificial cycle group. The livebirth rate after one FET was 174 (37%) of 476 in the natural cycle strategy group, 159 (33%) of 476 in the modified natural cycle strategy group, and 162 (34%) of 476 in the artificial cycle strategy group (relative risk 1\u00b707 [95% CI 0\u00b787-1\u00b733] for natural vs artificial cycle strategy, and 0\u00b798 [0\u00b779-1\u00b722] for modified natural vs artificial cycle strategy). Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between groups, as the power to detect small differences was low.              Interpretation:                    Although the livebirth rate was similar after natural, modified natural, and artificial cycle endometrial preparation strategies in ovulatory women undergoing FET IVF, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding the comparative safety of the three approaches.

Compared with advances achieved for other serious neonatal and early childhood conditions globally, progress in reducing neonatal sepsis has been much slower, especially in low-resource settings that have the highest burden of neonatal sepsis morbidity and mortality. By contrast to sepsis in older patients, there is no universally accepted neonatal sepsis definition. This poses substantial challenges in clinical practice, research, and health-care management, and has direct practical implications, such as diagnostic inconsistency, heterogeneous data collection and surveillance, and inappropriate treatment, health-resource allocation, and education. As the clinical manifestation of neonatal sepsis is frequently non-specific and the current diagnostic standard blood culture has performance limitations, new improved diagnostic techniques are required to guide appropriate and warranted antimicrobial treatment. Although antimicrobial therapy and supportive care continue as principal components of neonatal sepsis therapy, refining basic neonatal care to prevent sepsis through education and quality improvement initiatives remains paramount."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Anja Pinborg", "authorLink": "/?term=Pinborg+A&cauthor_id=38944043", "affiliationTitle": "Fertility Clinic, Department of Gynecology, Fertility and Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet-Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen DK-2100, Denmark; Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

New insights into pathophysiology and management suggest that the current gestational diabetes treatment approach should expand from a focus on late gestational diabetes to a personalised, integrated life course approach from preconception to postpartum and beyond. Early pregnancy lifestyle intervention could prevent late gestational diabetes. Early gestational diabetes diagnosis and treatment has been shown to be beneficial, especially when identified before 14 weeks of gestation. Early gestational diabetes screening now requires strategies for integration into routine antenatal care, alongside efforts to reduce variation in gestational diabetes care, across settings that differ between, and within, countries. Following gestational diabetes, an oral glucose tolerance test should be performed 6-12 weeks postpartum to assess the glycaemic state. Subsequent regular screening for both dysglycaemia and cardiometabolic disease is recommended, which can be incorporated alongside other family health activities. Diabetes prevention programmes for women with previous gestational diabetes might be enhanced using shared decision making and precision medicine. At all stages in this life course approach, across both high-resource and low-resource settings, a more systematic process for identifying and overcoming barriers to preventative care and treatment is needed to reduce the current global burden of gestational diabetes."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "The Lancet", "authorLink": "/?term=The+Lancet&cauthor_id=38909622", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}], "articleTitle": "Non-communicable diseases in reproductive care", "journalTitle": "Lancet", "journalLink": "/?term=%22Lancet%22%5Bjour%5D&sort=date&sort_order=desc", "cit": "2024 Jun 18:S0140-6736(24)01298-4.", "doi": "doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01298-4.", "secondaryDate": null, "grants": [], "abstract": "No abstract available"}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Cathy Eng", "authorLink": "/?term=Eng+C&cauthor_id=38909621", "affiliationTitle": "Division of Hematology and Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, USA.

Around 14% of pregnancies globally are affected by gestational diabetes; its prevalence varies with differences in risk factors and approaches to screening and diagnosis; and it is increasing in parallel with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes direct costs are US$1\u00b76 billion in the USA alone, largely due to complications including hypertensive disorders, preterm delivery, and neonatal metabolic and respiratory consequences. Between 30% and 70% of gestational diabetes is diagnosed in early pregnancy (ie, early gestational diabetes defined by hyperglycaemia before 20 weeks of gestation). Early gestational diabetes is associated with worse pregnancy outcomes compared with women diagnosed with late gestational diabetes (hyperglycaemia from 24 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation). Randomised controlled trials show benefits of treating gestational diabetes from 24 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation. The WHO 2013 recommendations for diagnosing gestational diabetes (one-step 75 gm 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation) are largely based on the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Study, which confirmed the linear association between pregnancy complications and late-pregnancy maternal glycaemia: a phenomenon that has now also been shown in early pregnancy. Recently, the Treatment of Booking Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (TOBOGM) trial showed benefit in diagnosis and treatment of early gestational diabetes for women with risk factors.

Historically, gestational diabetes was considered a pregnancy complication involving treatment of rising glycaemia late in the second trimester. However, recent evidence challenges this view. Pre-pregnancy and pregnancy-specific factors influence gestational glycaemia, with open questions regarding roles of non-glycaemic factors in the aetiology and consequences of gestational diabetes. Varying patterns of insulin secretion and resistance in early and late pregnancy underlie a heterogeneity of gestational diabetes in the timing and pathophysiological subtypes with clinical implications: early gestational diabetes and insulin resistant gestational diabetes subtypes are associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications. Metabolic perturbations of early gestational diabetes can affect early placental development, affecting maternal metabolism and fetal development. Fetal hyperinsulinaemia can affect the development of multiple fetal tissues, with short-term and long-term consequences. Pregnancy complications are prevented by managing glycaemia in early and late pregnancy in some, but not all women with gestational diabetes.

To determine facility-level factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. Methods. We obtained COVID-19 case counts at 88 ICE detention facilities from May 6, 2020, through June 21, 2021, from the COVID Prison Project. We obtained information about facility population size, facility type (dedicated to immigrants or mixed with other incarcerated populations), and facility operator (public vs private contractor) from third-party sources. We defined the threshold for a COVID-19 outbreak as a cumulative 3-week incidence of 10% or more of the detained population. Results. Sixty-three facilities (72%) had at least 1 outbreak. Facilities with any outbreak were significantly more likely to be privately operated (P < .001), to have larger populations (113 vs 37; P = .002), and to have greater changes in their population size over the study period (\u201256% vs -26%; P < .001). Conclusions. Several facility-level factors were associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks in ICE facilities. Public Health Implications. Structural and organizational factors that promote respiratory infection spread in ICE facilities must be addressed to protect detainee health. (Am J Public Health.

To assess the exposure of Chinese adolescents to proalcohol advertising and explore its association with alcohol consumption. Methods. A nationally and regionally representative school-based survey was conducted in mainland China in 2021 among students in grades 7 through 12, aged 13 to 18 years. We assessed adolescent exposure to proalcohol advertising and its association with alcohol consumption. Results. A total of 57 336 students participated in the survey, and the exposure percentage of proalcohol advertising was 66.8%, with no difference between boys and girls or between urban and rural areas. The top 3 exposure channels were television (51.8%), the Internet (43.6%), and outdoor billboards (42.0%). The exposure was higher among students who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (80.1% vs 65.1%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.29) and in the past 12 months (77.3% vs 61.7%; AOR = 1.30). However, no significant correlation was observed between advertising exposure and drunkenness. Conclusions. Approximately two thirds of Chinese adolescents have been exposed to proalcohol advertising in the past 30 days, with television, the Internet, and outdoor billboards being the most prevalent channels. Exposure to proalcohol advertising exhibits a positive correlation with drinking.

To examine the independent and joint effects of state legislation on minimum age for purchasing handguns and background checks on the suicide of young adults aged 18 to 20 years. Methods. We used negative binomial regressions with fixed effects for year and generalized estimating equations for state to estimate the effects of state legislation on annual counts of firearm, nonfirearm, and total young adult suicides in all 50 US states from 1991 to 2020. Results. Minimum age laws decreased the incidence rate of firearm suicide among young adults, an effect that was amplified in states with permit to purchase laws; there was no effect on the nonfirearm or total suicide rate. Permit to purchase laws significantly decreased the young adult firearm suicide incidence rate by 39% (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51, 0.74) and the overall suicide incidence rate by 14% (IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.75, 0.99), with no effect on the nonfirearm suicide rate. Conclusions. Permit to purchase laws are a more promising avenue for reducing young adult suicides than are age-based restrictions.

In popular press articles, bestselling books, and the US Environmental Protection Agency#QUOTE#s recently announced Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, scholars and policy experts have claimed that improved ventilation systems can lead to better productivity and performance. By reevaluating those claims in light of the history of public health in Great Britain and the United States, we found that better ventilation has frequently been proposed as a cost-effective and nonintrusive means of improving health in institutions experiencing structural and environmental public health problems. Furthermore, our examination of efforts to provide ventilation for enslaved people, incarcerated people, and the urban poor revealed a consistent lack of government regulation and a disassociation of air quality concerns from broader environmental, social, and economic realities. By continuing to ignore these broader contexts, current ventilation efforts risk repeating this pattern.

To determine the percentage of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities that offer HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Methods. We used a retrospective cross-sectional design with data from the National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey, which was administered to directors of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities in 2021. We evaluated the percentage of outpatient substance use treatment facilities offering PrEP and factors associated with the likelihood of offering PrEP. Results. We included 12 182 outpatient substance use treatment facilities. Of these, 637 (5.2%) offered PrEP. Offering HIV treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 45.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.0, 56.9) and offering programs for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning) people (AOR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.6) were associated with higher likelihoods of offering PrEP. Conclusions. PrEP is highly effective and recommended for patients at risk for HIV from injection drug use. Nearly 95% of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities did not offer PrEP-a missed opportunity for harm reduction through primary HIV prevention. Public Health Implications. Diversification of the array of available HIV PrEP options and the ongoing HIV and opioid use epidemics require outpatient substance use treatment facilities to expand PrEP availability.

To demonstrate the spatially uneven effects of abortion restriction laws in Texas. Methods. We used network analysis to determine the change in distance to the nearest surgical abortion provider for 5253 Texas neighborhoods after the passing of Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB8; 2021) and the US Supreme Court#QUOTE#s Dobbs v Jackson Women#QUOTE#s Health Organization (2022) decision. We identified associations between key measures of neighborhood socioeconomic context and change in distance to providers using multivariable linear regression models. Results. After the Dobbs decision, Texas residents experienced an average change in distance to the nearest provider of 457 miles (SD = 179). Neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage experienced the greatest increase in distance to abortion providers after SB8#QUOTE#s passing, and neighborhoods with high levels of income inequality experienced the greatest increase in distance after the Dobbs decision. Conclusions. We document the rapidly changing abortion landscape in a highly restrictive state and show that women living in more disadvantaged and unequal areas are most affected by the increasing distance to providers. Public Health Implications. Our methods and findings will continue to be relevant in understanding the burden placed on women in areas where medical abortion has been restricted because of the Dobbs decision.

To examine changes in cause-specific pregnancy-associated deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity and assess changes in racial and ethnic inequities in pregnancy-associated deaths. Methods. We used US vital statistics mortality data from 2018 to 2021 to identify pregnancy-associated deaths among females aged 15 to 44 years. We calculated crude pregnancy-associated death rates (deaths per 100 000 live births) by year, cause, and race/ethnicity, percent change in death rate, and the inequity (difference) in rate for each racial or ethnic group compared with non-Hispanic White people. Results. The pregnancy-associated death rate for obstetric, drug-related, homicide, and other causes of death increased during 2020, and obstetric deaths continued to increase in 2021. Overall estimates mask 2021 increases in drug-related deaths among Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), and non-Hispanic Asian people; increases in homicide among most racial and ethnic groups; and increases in suicide among Hispanic, non-Hispanic AI/AN, and non-Hispanic Asian people. Conclusions. We found disproportionate increases in pregnancy-associated deaths from nonobstetric causes among minoritized racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To examine the accessibility of hospital facilities with maternity care services in 1 rural county in Alabama in preparation for the initiation of prenatal care services at a federally qualified health center. Methods. We analyzed driving distance (in miles) from maternal city of residence in Conecuh County, Alabama to hospital of delivery, using 2019-2021 vital statistics data and geographic information system (GIS) software. Results. A total of 370 births to mothers who have home addresses in Conecuh County were reported, and 368 of those were in hospital facilities. The majority of deliveries were less than 30 miles (median = 23 miles) from the maternal city of residence. Some women traveled more than 70 miles for obstetrical care. Conclusions. Pregnant patients in Conecuh County experience significant geographic barriers related to perinatal care access. Using GIS for this analysis is a promising approach to better understand the unique challenges of pregnant individuals in this rural population. Public health policy efforts need to be geographically tailored to address these disparities.

To improve COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant and recently pregnant women from a baseline rate of 30.8% to 60% over 6 months in a marginalized population. Methods. This quality improvement (QI) project was conducted in a federally qualified health center in Western New York between November 2021 and April 2022, using a Lean Six Sigma method. The QI team created a fishbone diagram, process flow map, and driver diagram. Significant barriers were multiple preferred languages, limited health literacy, and a knowledge gap. Increased vaccination rates were the outcome measure. The process measures were attendance at educational events and increased knowledge in community health workers (CHWs) and doulas. Education for CHWs and patients, creating multilingual educational resources, and motivational interviewing sessions for CHWs and patients were the major interventions. We performed data analysis by using weekly run charts and a statistical process control chart. Results. We achieved a sustainable increase in the COVID-19 vaccination rates in women from 30.0% to 48% within 6 months. Conclusions. Patient education in their preferred languages and at health literacy levels and CHWs#QUOTE# engagement played a crucial role in achieving success.

One of the main contributors to this phenomenon is a cited lack of education and knowledge among children regarding active travel (AT), specifically road safety. To address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an online road safety education intervention to promote AT among children and their parents.              Methods:                    Applying the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) for intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, we designed and assessed a four-module online road safety education intervention with a sample of 57 parent-child dyads using a 23 factorial design featuring both qualitative and quantitative analyses.              Results:                    Main intervention feasibility findings include positive and critical feedback on the program#QUOTE#s content and design, and moderate participant engagement as reflected by program retention and completion rates. With respect to the preliminary intervention effectiveness on children, a significant improvement in road safety knowledge scores was observed for groups that feature the #QUOTE#wheeling safety and skills#QUOTE# module. Slight improvements in AT knowledge scores across all the intervention groups were observed, but were not of significance. Preliminary intervention effectiveness on select parental AT practices and perceptions saw significant improvements in some groups. Groups that featured the #QUOTE#wheeling safety and skills#QUOTE# module exhibited significantly higher guided choice scores upon completion of the program than those who did not receive this component.              Conclusion:                    The MOST framework allowed us to design and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an online road safety education intervention. The developed intervention has demonstrated that it has the potential to improve children#QUOTE#s road safety knowledge and some areas of parental AT practices and perceptions, to which improvements may be attributed to the inclusion of the #QUOTE#wheeling safety and skills#QUOTE# module, suggesting that the targeted focus on cycling skills is a prioritized area. AT programming and practice implications are discussed. Future research is encouraged to refine modules to better reflect the priorities of children and parents and to test these refined components among larger samples.

Methods:                    In total, 17,472 participants (\u2265 45 years old) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, Wave 4, 2018) were analyzed. Cognitive performance including episodic memory and executive function was assessed using Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Other confounding variables included socio-economic characteristics, medical status, and lifestyle-related information. Multiple linear regression models were used to test the association between cognitive performance and WeChat usage by introducing covariates hierarchically. Subgroup analyses of age and gender were conducted to estimate the robustness of the primary findings.              Results:                    After adjusting for multiple confounders across all linear models, WeChat usage is significantly associated with executive function, episodic memory, and global cognitive performance (all p values<0.05). Such results remained robust in subgroup analyses, stratified by age and gender, and also verified according to longitudinal analyses. Compared to #QUOTE#Chat-only#QUOTE# users who only used WeChat for online interpersonal communication, further usage of WeChat functions such as using #QUOTE#Moments#QUOTE# appeared to be significantly associated with better cognitive performance, especially for episodic memory.

However, it is unknown if certain types of leisure-time physical activity contribute to these benefits in different ways; this knowledge could enhance public health efforts. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence of the longitudinal associations between childhood and adolescent leisure-time physical activity on adulthood physical activity behaviours and health outcomes.              Methods:                    A systematic search of the literature was conducted across five databases from inception to July 2022. English, peer-reviewed observational studies with a minimum of two timepoints of data collection were eligible for inclusion. We included studies that investigated the association between participation in leisure-time physical activity types in children and adolescents (i.e., 5-18 years), and physical activity, mental health, or cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood (i.e., \u2265 18 years).              Results:                    Fourteen studies were included in the review, totalling 34,388 observations across five countries. Running in adolescence was associated with increased adulthood physical activity in both sexes, while sports involvement was associated with an increase in physical activity in males only. Adolescent team sports participation was associated with reduced odds of early adulthood depression, with varying findings for anxiety disorders. There was preliminary evidence of minimum threshold requirements for participation in certain activities before associations with future physical activity or health outcome benefits were observed.              Conclusions:                    Preliminary findings suggest that the lifelong behavioural and health benefits of adolescent participation in leisure-time physical activity appear to be related to the type of activity undertaken, with potential differences between sexes. With the rarity of longitudinal studies spanning from childhood into adulthood, these findings provide important insights for public health strategies to optimise lifelong health and physical activity participation.

This study aims to analyse the impact of smoking on global deaths, and its association with mortality across the main income groups.              Methods:                    The comprehensive analysis spans 199 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. The study categorises countries into four income groups: high income, upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income.              Results:                    The findings underscore the profound impact of global tobacco smoking on mortality. Notably, cardiovascular disease mortality is notably affected in both upper-middle-income and high-income groups. Chronic respiratory disease mortality rates show a significant impact across all income groups. Moreover, stroke-related mortality is observed in the lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income groups. These results highlight the pervasive influence of smoking prevalence on global mortality, affecting individuals across various socioeconomic levels.              Conclusion:                    The study underscores the critical implications of smoking on mortality rates, particularly in high-income countries. It emphasises the urgency of targeted interventions in these regions to address the specific challenges posed by tobacco smoking on public health. Policy recommendations include implementing prohibitive measures extending to indoor public areas such as workplaces and public transportation services. Furthermore, allocating funds for research on tobacco and health, is imperative to ensure policymakers are consistently informed about emerging facts and trends in this complex domain.

This includes a wide range of experiences, from subtle expressions of hostility to physical assault, that can also be of a sexual nature (e.g., sexual harassment or assault). This systematic review aimed to summarize findings about the prospective associations of work-related GBVH with people#QUOTE#s health and occupational situation.              Methods:                    We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for prospective studies in English from 1990 to May 24, 2023. Studies were included if they concerned a working population, exposure to any form of GBVH in the work context, and a health outcome or manifest occupational outcome. Quality was assessed with a modified version of the Cochrane #QUOTE#Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies#QUOTE#, and studies assessed as low quality were excluded from the narrative synthesis. For the narrative synthesis, we grouped the results by similar exposures and outcomes and reported the strength and statistical significance of the associations.              Results:                    Of the 1 937 screened records, 29 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Studies were mainly conducted in the USA and northern Europe and investigated exposure to sexual violence or harassment (SVH). Only two included studies investigated non-sexual kinds of GBVH. Consistently, studies showed associations of work-related SVH with poor mental health and there were indications of an association with hazardous substance use. There was no consistent evidence for an association of SVH with subsequent sickness absence, and there were too few studies concerning physical health and occupational outcomes to synthesize the results.              Conclusions:                    There is consistent evidence of work-related SVH as a risk factor for subsequent poor mental health. There is no indication that the health consequences of SVH differ between women and men, although women are more often affected. There is a need for conceptual consistency, the consideration of non-sexual behaviors and prospective studies that test clear hypotheses about the temporal sequence of events.

Through long-term, systematic, continuous data collection and analysis, Nosocomial infection surveillance (NIS) systems are constructed in each hospital; while these data are only used as real-time surveillance but fail to realize the prediction and early warning function. Study is to screen effective predictors from the routine NIS data, through integrating the multiple risk factors and Machine learning (ML) methods, and eventually realize the trend prediction and risk threshold of Incidence of Nosocomial infection (INI).              Methods:                    We selected two representative hospitals in southern and northern China, and collected NIS data from 2014 to 2021. Thirty-nine factors including hospital operation volume, nosocomial infection, antibacterial drug use and outdoor temperature data, etc. Five ML methods were used to fit the INI prediction model respectively, and to evaluate and compare their performance.              Results:                    Compared with other models, Random Forest showed the best performance (5-fold AUC = 0.983) in both hospitals, followed by Support Vector Machine. Among all the factors, 12 indicators were significantly different between high-risk and low-risk groups for INI (P < 0.05). After screening the effective predictors through importance analysis, prediction model of the time trend was successfully constructed (R2 = 0.473 and 0.780, BIC = -1.537 and -0.731).

Post-COVID Syndrome, or PCS, which is defined as signs and symptoms that develop during or after infection in line with COVID-19, continue beyond 12 weeks, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis, has also gained attention. We systematically reviewed and determined the pooled prevalence estimate of PCS worldwide based on published literature.              Methods:                    Relevant articles from the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Ovid MEDLINE databases were screened using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-guided systematic search process. The included studies were in English, published from January 2020 to April 2024, had overall PCS prevalence as one of the outcomes studied, involved a human population with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and undergone assessment at 12 weeks post-COVID infection or beyond. As the primary outcome measured, the pooled prevalence of PCS was estimated from a meta-analysis of the PCS prevalence data extracted from individual studies, which was conducted via the random-effects model. This study has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023435280).              Results:                    Forty eight studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. 16 were accepted for meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence for PCS worldwide, which was 41.79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.70-43.88%, I2 = 51%, p = 0.03). Based on different assessment or follow-up timepoints after acute COVID-19 infection, PCS prevalence estimated at \u2265 3rd, \u2265 6th, and \u2265 12th months timepoints were each 45.06% (95% CI: 41.25-48.87%), 41.30% (95% CI: 34.37-48.24%), and 41.32% (95% CI: 39.27-43.37%), respectively. Sex-stratified PCS prevalence was estimated at 47.23% (95% CI: 44.03-50.42%) in male and 52.77% (95% CI: 49.58-55.97%) in female. Based on continental regions, pooled PCS prevalence was estimated at 46.28% (95% CI: 39.53%-53.03%) in Europe, 46.29% (95% CI: 35.82%-56.77%) in America, 49.79% (95% CI: 30.05%-69.54%) in Asia, and 42.41% (95% CI: 0.00%-90.06%) in Australia.              Conclusion:                    The prevalence estimates in this meta-analysis could be used in further comprehensive studies on PCS, which might enable the development of better PCS management plans to reduce the effect of PCS on population health and the related economic burden.

Action can be initiated by the manufacturing company or by the order of a regulatory body. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of Rwanda FDA drug recall and determine the association between classes of recall and recall characteristics.              Methodology:                    This was a retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study. Data about recalled drugs were collected from the official website of the Rwanda FDA in the section assigned to #QUOTE#Safety alerts#QUOTE#. The search included data reported between February 2019 and February 2023 covering four years. Data cleaning was conducted in Microsoft Excel to address missing data and inconsistencies, followed by importation into STATA/SE software version 17.0 for further cleaning and subsequent analysis. Descriptive statistics were computed for independent variables. Categorical variables were described in terms of counts and relative frequencies. Bivariate analyses used Pearson#QUOTE#s chi-square test to illustrate the associations between categorical independent variables and recall classes.              Results:                    The study revealed that a large proportion (33.0%) of the recalled products belonged to Class I. Antibiotics constituted 35.8% of the recalled products, with contamination emerging as a leading cause and responsible for 26.4% of the recalls. India was the leading manufacturing country for the recalled products (29.2%), followed by France (17.9%), China (17.0%), Kenya (13.2%), and Russia (6.6%). An association was found between the class of recall and several recall characteristics, including the year of recall, drug category, safety issues, reporter, and manufacturing country.              Conclusion:                    This study provides a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of drug recalls in Rwanda. The insights gained contribute to a nuanced understanding of recall dynamics and provide evidence-based strategies to enhance drug quality, safety, efficacy, regulatory compliance, and patient welfare.

Prolonged sedentary time (ST) is associated with a slower HRR. However, it is not clear how much moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is required to mitigate the adverse effects of sedentary behavior on HRR in young and middle-aged adults. This study aimed to examine the joint association of ST and MVPA with abnormal HRR in this population.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 1253 participants (aged 20-50 years, 67.8% male) from an observational study assessing cardiopulmonary fitness in Fujian Province, China. HRR measured via cardiopulmonary exercise tests on a treadmill was calculated as the difference between heart rate at peak exercise and 2 min after exercise. When the HRR was \u2264 42 beats\u00b7minute-1 within this time, it was considered abnormal. ST and MVPA were assessed by the IPAQ-LF. Individuals were classified as having a low sedentary time (LST [< 6 h\u00b7day-1]) or high sedentary time (HST [\u2265 6 h\u00b7day-1]) and according to their MVPA level (low MVPA [0-149 min\u00b7week-1], medium MVPA [150-299 min\u00b7week-1], high MVPA [\u2265 300 min\u00b7week-1]). Finally, six ST-MVPA groups were derived. Associations between ST-MVPA groups with abnormal HRR incidence were examined using logistic regression models.              Results:                    53.1% of the young and middle-aged adults had less than 300 min of MVPA per week. In model 2, adjusted for possible confounders (e.g. age, sex, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, sleep status, body mass index), HST was associated with higher odds of an abnormal HRR compared to LST (odds ratio (OR) = 1.473, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.172-1.852). Compared with the reference group (HST and low MVPA), the HST and high MVPA groups have a lower chance of abnormal HRR (OR, 95% CI = 0.553, 0.385-0.795). Compared with individuals with HST and low MVPA, regardless of whether MVPA is low, medium, or high, the odds of abnormal HRR in individuals with LST is significantly reduced (OR, 95% CI = 0.515, 0.308-0.857 for LST and low MVPA; OR, 95% CI = 0.558, 0.345-0.902 for LST and medium MVPA; OR, 95% CI = 0.476, 0.326-0.668 for LST and high MVPA).              Conclusion:                    Higher amounts of MVPA appears to mitigate the increased odds of an abnormal HRR associated with HST for healthy young and middle-aged adults.

Parental support, peer support, and social connectedness play protective roles in mitigating NSSI in this population. However, the precise impact of the combined effects of parental and peer support on bullying and NSSI requires further investigation.              Methods:                    This study employed the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale, Delaware Bullying Victimisation Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, and the Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory to survey 1277 Chinese adolescents. Polynomial regression analysis and response surface analysis were applied to examine the mediating role of bullying and social connectedness in the relationship between parental and peer support matching and NSSI.              Results:                    The results indicate that parental support (r = 0.287, P < 0.001), peer support (r = 0.288, P < 0.001), and social connectedness (r = 0.401, P < 0.001) were protective factors against NSSI in adolescents. Conversely, bullying (r = 0.425, P < 0.001) acts as a risk factor for NSSI in this population. Adolescents with low parental and peer support experienced more bullying than those with high parental and peer support, while those with low parental but high peer support experienced less bullying than those with high parental but low peer support (R^2 = 0.1371, P < 0.001). Social connectedness moderated the effect between bullying and NSSI in this model (\u03b2 = 0.006, P < 0.001).              Limitations:                    Due to the under-representation of participants and lack of longitudinal data support, the explanatory power of causality between variables was limited. Future studies should include national samples and incorporate longitudinal studies to enhance the generalisability and robustness of the findings.              Conclusion:                    This study reveals the influence mechanism of parental and peer support matching experienced by adolescents on bullying and NSSI and the moderating role of social connectedness. These findings enrich the developmental theory of adolescent NSSI and provide reference for the prevention and intervention of adolescent NSSI behaviour.

The CDC#QUOTE#s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) routinely recommends MenACWY vaccine for all 11- to 12-year-olds with a booster dose at 16 years. MenB vaccination is recommended based on shared clinical decision-making (SCDM) for 16- to 23-year-olds. Recently, the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine (MenABCWY) was recommended by the ACIP. Meningococcal vaccine uptake is suboptimal across the country, particularly among individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES), despite these recommendations. The objective of the spatial analyses was to assess the relationship between stocking of MenACWY and MenB vaccines, area-level SES, and state-level policies.              Methods:                    The number of MenACWY and MenB doses stocked by vaccinators was obtained from IQVIA and the CDC#QUOTE#s Vaccine for Children (VFC) program and compiled into a county-level dataset from 2016 to 2019. SES, as measured using the CDC#QUOTE#s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), state-level school recommendations, and universal purchasing programs were among the main county-level covariates included to control for factors likely influencing stocking. Data were stratified by public and private market. Bayesian spatial regression models were developed to quantify the variations in rates of stocking and the relative rates of stocking of both vaccines.              Results:                    After accounting for county-level characteristics, lower SES counties tended to have fewer doses of MenB relative to MenACWY on both public and private markets. Lower SES counties tended to have more supply of public vs. private doses. Universal purchasing programs had a strong effect on the markets for both vaccines shifting nearly all doses to the public market. School vaccination strategy was key for improving stocking rates.              Conclusions:                    Overall, the results show that MenACWY has greater stock relative to MenB across the US. This difference is exacerbated in vulnerable areas without school entry requirements for vaccination and results in inequity of vaccine availability. Beyond state-level policy and SES differences, SCDM recommendations may be a contributing factor, although this was not directly assessed by our model.

To address this inequality, it is crucial scientists, practitioners and policy makers understand the factors that hinder and assist healthy food choice in these individuals. In this scoping review, we aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to healthy eating among disadvantaged individuals living in the UK. Additionally, we used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to synthesise results and provide a guide for the development of theory-informed behaviour change interventions. Five databases were searched, (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for articles assessing healthy dietary intake of disadvantaged adults living in the UK. A total of 50 papers (34 quantitative; 16 qualitative) were included in this review. Across all studies we identified 78 barriers and 49 facilitators found to either impede and/or encourage healthy eating. Both barriers and facilitators were more commonly classified under the Environmental, Context and Resources TDF domain, with 74% of studies assessing at least one factor pertaining to this domain. Results thus indicate that context related factors such as high cost and accessibility of healthy food, rather than personal factors, such as lack of efficiency in healthy lifestyle drive unhealthy eating in disadvantaged individuals in the UK. We discuss how such factors are largely overlooked in current interventions and propose that more effort should be directed towards implementing interventions that specifically target infrastructures rather than individuals.

However, insufficient understanding of components#QUOTE# mutual exclusion limits the exploration of the associations between all movement behaviors and health outcomes. The aim of this study was to employ compositional data analysis (CoDA) approach to investigate the associations between 24-hour movement behaviors and overall CVH.              Methods:                    Data from 581 participants, including 230 women, were collected from the 2005-2006 wave of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This dataset included information on the duration of SB and PA, derived from ActiGraph accelerometers, as well as self-reported sleep duration. The assessment of CVH was conducted in accordance with the criteria outlined in Life#QUOTE#s Simple 7, encompassing the evaluation of both health behaviors and health factors. Compositional linear regression was utilized to examine the cross-sectional associations of 24-hour movement behaviors and each component with CVH score. Furthermore, the study predicted the potential differences in CVH score that would occur by reallocating 10 to 60 min among different movement behaviors.              Results:                    A significant association was observed between 24-hour movement behaviors and overall CVH (p < 0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders. Substituting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for other components was strongly associated with favorable differences in CVH score (p < 0.05), whether in one-for-one reallocations or one-for-remaining reallocations. Allocating time away from MVPA consistently resulted in larger negative differences in CVH score (p < 0.05). For instance, replacing 10 min of light physical activity (LPA) with MVPA was related to an increase of 0.21 in CVH score (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.11 to 0.31). Conversely, when the same duration of MVPA was replaced with LPA, CVH score decreased by 0.67 (95% CI -0.99 to -0.35). No such significance was discovered for all duration reallocations involving only LPA, SB, and sleep (p > 0.05).              Conclusions:                    MVPA seems to be as a pivotal determinant for enhancing CVH among general adult population, relative to other movement behaviors.

The study aimed to analyze lifestyle patterns and their impact on depression in individuals with diabetes and to explore the role of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) in the relationship between lifestyle patterns and depression.              Methods:                    Data was attained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2009 and 2020. A latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on 3,009 diabetic adults based on lifestyle behaviors. A generalised linear model (GLM) was employed to analyse the effects of different lifestyle patterns on depression. The mediation effect model was utilised to examine the relationship between lifestyle patterns, DII and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores.              Results:                    The cohort was divided through LCA into unhealthy lifestyle (44.53%), unhealthy but non-alcohol use (48.06%) and healthy but smoking (7.41%) groups of lifestyle behaviors, the unhealthy but non-alcohol use group was identified as a risk factor for depression (OR = 1.379, 95%CI = 1.095 ~ 1.735, P = 0.006). The DII partially mediated the relationship between the unhealthy but non-alcohol use group and PHQ-9, and fully mediated the relationship between the healthy but smoking group and PHQ-9, with effect coefficients of - 0.018 (95%CI: -0.044 ~ - 0.001) and - 0.035 (95%CI: -0.083 ~ - 0.001).              Conclusions:                    Lifestyle patterns significantly influence the occurrence of depression among diabetes patients. The dietary inflammation plays a varying mediating role between different lifestyle patterns and depression. Restricting pro-inflammatory diets or encouraging anti-inflammatory diets, combined with the promotion of healthy lifestyle practices, may be an effective method for preventing and alleviating symptoms of depression among patients with diabetes.

Screening for substance use disorders in people who use drugs is vital in preventive health care, as it can help to identify problematic use early. Screening can aid in referring those in need, for the most appropriate treatment and care. Thus, preventing them from developing severe substance use disorders with complications. The Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) is an evidence-based tool widely used to assess the severity of psychoactive drug use. This study aimed to culturally adapt and evaluate the validity and reliability of the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) in Sri Lanka.              Methods:                    The DAST-10 was culturally adapted, and the nine-item Sinhala version (DAST-SL) was validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The validation study was conducted in the Kandy district among people who use drugs, recruited using respondent-driven sampling. Criterion validity of the questionnaire was assessed by taking the diagnosis by a psychiatrist as the gold standard. Cut-off values for the modified questionnaire were developed by constructing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The reliability of the DAST-SL was assessed by measuring its internal consistency and test re-test reliability.              Results:                    The validated DAST-SL demonstrated a one-factor model. A cut-off value of \u2265 2 demonstrated the presence of substance use disorder and had a sensitivity of 98.7%, specificity of 91.7%, a positive predictive value of 98.8% and a negative predictive value of 91.3%. The area under the curve of the ROC curve was 0.98. A cut-off score of \u2264 1 was considered a low level of problems associated with drug use. The DAST-SL score of 2-3 demonstrated a moderate level of problem severity, a score of 4-6 demonstrated a substantial level of problems, and a score of \u2265 7 demonstrated a severe level of drug-related problems. The questionnaire demonstrated high reliability with an internal consistency of 0.80 determined by Kuder-Richardson Formula-20 and an inter-class correlation coefficient of 0.97 for test re-test reliability.

This study investigated the relationships between the longitudinal changes of adult health behaviours and childhood family structure.              Methods:                    From Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 questionnaires, we collected data on childhood family structure at the age of 14 (#QUOTE#two-parent family#QUOTE#, #QUOTE#one parent not living at home/no information on father#QUOTE#, and #QUOTE#father or mother deceased#QUOTE#), and on health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity status) at the ages of 31 and 46. We used the multinomial logistic regression model to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted associations between childhood family structures and the longitudinal changes between 31 and 46 years of health behaviours (four-category variables).              Results:                    Of the study sample (n = 5431; 55.5% females), 7.1% of the offspring were represented in the #QUOTE#One parent not living at home/no information on father#QUOTE# subgroup, 6.3% in the #QUOTE#Father or mother deceased#QUOTE# subgroup and 86.6% in the #QUOTE#Two-parent family#QUOTE#. #QUOTE#One parent not living at home/no information on father#QUOTE# offspring were approximately twice as likely to smoke (adjusted OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.70-2.81) and heavily consume alcohol (adjusted OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.25-3.16) at both times in adulthood, relative to not smoking or not heavily consume alcohol, and compared with #QUOTE#two-parent family#QUOTE# offspring.

Methods:                    Cross-sectional and longitudinal design (washout period for reliability). The study was conducted in two Brazilian states, Maranh\u00e3o and S\u00e3o Paulo, and included Brazilian adults, irregular exercisers, former exercisers or non-exercise practitioners, aged 18 to 59 years and with chronic pain. The instruments used in this study were: the REPEAS, the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), the Baecke Habitual Physical Activity Questionnaire (BHPAQ), the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for general pain (RMDQ-g). The evaluation focused on structural validity, construct validity, reliability (with standard error of measurement and minimum detectable change), internal consistency, and floor and ceiling effects.              Results:                    The two-dimensional structure was tested through confirmatory factor analysis, which resulted in adequate fit indeces: chi-square values/degrees of freedom = 1.541, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.966, comparative fit index = 0.974, root mean square error of approximation = 0.074, and standardized root mean square residual = 0.068. Additionally, satisfactory factor loadings (> 0.40) were obtained. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were adequate for the environmental factors domain (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79, Cronbach#QUOTE#s alpha = 0.88) and the personal factors domain (ICC = 0.97, Cronbach#QUOTE#s alpha = 0.93). In hypothesis testing for construct validity, we observed a significant correlation with magnitude below 0.30 of the environmental factors domain of the REPEAS with RMDQ-g, PSEQ and sport domain of the BHPAQ. For the personal factors domain, we observed a significant correlation with a magnitude of 0.30 to 0.50 with RMDQ-g, PSEQ, and sport domain of the BHPAQ, and below 0.30 with leisure domain of the BHPAQ. No floor or ceiling effects were found for the REPEAS domains.              Conclusion:                    The REPEAS is a valid instrument with a two-dimensional internal structure consisting of 12 items. It has a reliable construct and is suitable for use in the clinical and epidemiological context for adults with chronic pain in Brazil.

However, their specific influence on the regulation of male ejaculation remains unclear. This study explores the relationship between shift work, SWSD, and PE.              Methods:                    From April to October 2023, a cross-sectional survey was conducted across five regions of China to explore the work schedules, sleep quality, and sexual function of male workers. Participants#QUOTE# sleep quality was evaluated using a validated SWSD questionnaire, and their erectile function and ejaculatory control were assessed with the International Inventory of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) scores, respectively. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were employed to identify risk factors associated with PE. Confounders were controlled using multiple regression models, and clinical prediction models were developed to predict PE onset and assess the contribution of risk factors.              Results:                    The study included 1239 eligible participants, comprising 840 non-shift workers and 399 shift workers (148 with SWSD and 251 without SWSD). Compared to non-shift working males, those involved in shift work (\u03b2 1.58, 95% CI 0.75 - 2.42, p < 0.001) and those suffering from SWSD (\u03b2 2.86, 95% CI 1.86 - 3.85, p < 0.001) they had significantly higher PEDT scores. Additionally, we identified daily sleep of less than six hours, depression, anxiety, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, frequent alcohol consumption (more than twice a week), and erectile dysfunction as risk factors for PE. The predictive model for PE demonstrated commendable efficacy.              Conclusion:                    Both shift work and SWSD significantly increase the risk of premature ejaculation, with the risk magnifying in tandem with the duration of shift work.

This population-based cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the associations between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and pain in Chinese adults and evaluate whether physical activity and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics modify this associations.              Methods:                    Cross-sectional data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), were utilized in this study.

Methods:                    Incidence data were retrieved from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) volumes I-XI, and mortality data were obtained from the latest update of the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database. We used join-point regression analysis to examine historical incidence and mortality trends and used the package NORDPRED in R to predict the number of deaths and mortality rates by 2035 by country and sex.              Results:                    More than 1,089,000 new cases of gastric cancer and 769,000 related deaths were reported in 2020. The average annual percent change (AAPC) in the incidence of gastric cancer from 2003 to 2012 among the male population, South Korea, Japan, Malta, Canada, Cyprus, and Switzerland showed an increasing trend (P > 0.05); among the female population, Canada [AAPC, 1.2; (95%Cl, 0.5-2), P < 0.05] showed an increasing trend; and South Korea, Ecuador, Thailand, and Cyprus showed an increasing trend (P > 0.05).

Summarizing the available research on the nutritional status and dietary habits of adolescents in Nigeria is crucial.              Objective:                    This study aims to systematically evaluate available literature on the nutritional status of adolescent aged 10 to 19years in Nigeria.              Methodology:                    A systematic search using PRISMA guideline was conducted. Three electronic databases were searched i.e., PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus using specific terms and keywords for online articles published between 2013 and 2023. After applying specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 51 articles were selected for data extraction, synthesis and quality assessment.              Results:                    Of the 51 included studies, 78.4% were conducted in the Southern Nigeria, 11.8% in the Northern Nigeria and 9.8% included both regions. The prevalence of overweight ranged between 0.8 and 31% and obesity ranged between 0.1 and 14%. The prevalence of thinness, stunting and underweight ranged between 3 and 31%, 0.4 to 41.6%, 0.3 to 73.3% respectively. The review also identified an inadequate intake of essential nutrients including iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A, C, D, niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, cobalamin, and folate, with vitamin A deficiency prevalence ranges from 44 to 96%. The dietary patterns were characterized by a high consumption of cereals grains and starchy foods, low animal proteins, fast-food with soft drinks, and limited consumption of fruits and vegetables along with meal skipping.              Conclusion:                    These findings portray a complex picture of the nutritional challenges faced by this demographic group, highlighting both undernutrition and overnutrition, poor eating behaviour and micronutrient deficiency as significant concerns. The review revealed regional disparities in research representation, with a concentration of studies in Southern Nigeria. This highlights the importance of directing research efforts toward the northern regions, where the prevalence of nutritional issues is equally severe, but less studied.

Furthermore, the past decade has seen an increase in bi-partisan exclusionary immigration and immigrant policies. Immigration enforcement has been a major topic during the 2024 Presidential election cycle, portending an augmentation of exclusionary policies towards immigrants. Within this context, scholars have called for research that highlights the ways in which Latin\u00e9 communities navigate exclusionary immigration and immigrant policies, and implications for health. This study examines ways in which Mexican-origin women in a midwestern northern border community navigate restrictive immigration and immigrant policies to access health-promoting resources and care for their well-being.              Methods:                    We conducted a grounded theory analysis drawing on interviews with 48 Mexican-origin women in Detroit, Michigan, who identified as being in the first, 1.5, or second immigrant generation. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish, depending on participants#QUOTE# preferences, and were conducted at community-based organizations or other locations convenient to participants in 2013-2014.              Results:                    Women reported encountering an interconnected web of institutional processes that used racializing markers to infer legal status and eligibility to access health-promoting resources. Our findings highlight women#QUOTE#s use of both individual and collective action to navigate exclusionary policies and processes, working to: (1) maintain access to health-promoting resources; (2) limit labeling and stigmatization; and (3) mitigate adverse impacts of immigrant policing on health and well-being. The strategies women engaged were shaped by both the immigration processes and structures they confronted, and the resources to which they had access to within their social network.              Conclusions:                    Our findings suggest a complex interplay of immigration-related policies and processes, social networks, and health-relevant resources. They highlight the importance of inclusive policies to promote health for immigrant communities. These findings illuminate women#QUOTE#s agency in the context of structural violence facing immigrant women and are particularly salient in the face of anti-immigrant rhetoric and exclusionary immigration and immigrant policies.

Methods:                    The present study comprised 1,113 community-dwelling older females, with an average age of 65 \u00b1 2 years. We employed a linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between patterns of PA and SB with PF. PA variables consisted of total PA time, bouted PA time (a continuous PA that lasts equal to or more than 10 min), and sporadic PA time (a continuous PA that lasts less than 10 min). SB variables included total SB time, 30-min bout of SB (a continuous SB that lasts equal to or more than 30 min), and 60-min bout of SB (a continuous SB that lasts equal to or more than 60 min). PF variables comprised handgrip strength (HGS), one-legged stance test with eyes closed (OLSTEC), usual walking speed (UWS), maximum walking speed (MWS) and chair-stand time (CT). To explore the joint effects of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) and SB on PF, we divided the duration of SB and MVPA participation in older women into different combinations: low MVPA & high SB, low MVPA & low SB, high MVPA & high SB, high MVPA & low SB.              Results:                    The study revealed a significant association between 30-min bout of SB and CT, which remained after adjusting for total MVPA time (P = 0.021). Both total MVPA and bouted MVPA were found to be positively associated with better UWS, MWS, CT, and PF Z-score. When the combination of low MVPA & high SB was used as a reference, the regression coefficients for PF ascended by 1.32 (P < 0.001) in the high MVPA & high SB group and by 1.13 (P < 0.001) in the high MVPA & low SB group.              Conclusions:                    A significant association was observed between poorer lower limb function and prolonged, uninterrupted SB in older women, rather than with the total SB time. Concurrently, the insufficient engagement in MVPA may also be a crucial factor contributing to poorer PF in older women. Engaging in longer durations and higher intensity of PA, such as bouts of MVPA lasting a minimum of 10 min or longer, may contribute to better PF.

However, oral PrEP utilization among MSM in China remains below 1%. While existing literature has primarily focused on oral PrEP preference and willingness, there is limited exploration of the underlying factors contributing to oral PrEP cessation in China. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the factors associated with oral PrEP cessation among MSM in China.              Methods:                    Assisted by MSM community organizations, we collected 6,535 electronic questionnaires from 31 regions across China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. The questionnaire focused on investigating MSM#QUOTE#s awareness, willingness, usage, and cessation of oral PrEP. Additionally, 40 participants were randomly chosen for key informant interviews. These qualitative interviews aimed to explore the reasons influencing MSM discontinuing oral PrEP.              Results:                    We eventually enrolled 6535 participants. Among the 685 participants who had used oral PrEP, 19.70% (135/685) ceased oral PrEP. The results indicated that individuals spending > \u00a51000 on a bottle of PrEP (aOR = 2.999, 95% CI: 1.886-4.771) were more likely to cease oral PrEP compared to those spending \u2264 \u00a51000. Conversely, individuals opting for on-demand PrEP (aOR = 0.307, 95% CI: 0.194-0.485) and those using both daily and on-demand PrEP (aOR = 0.114, 95% CI: 0.058-0.226) were less likely to cease PrEP compared to those using daily PrEP. The qualitative analysis uncovered eight themes influencing oral PrEP cessation: (i) High cost and low adherence; (ii) Sexual inactivity; (iii) Lack of knowledge about PrEP; (iv) Trust in current prevention strategies; (v) Poor quality of medical service and counseling; (vi) PrEP stigma; (vii) Partner and relationship factors; (viii) Access challenges.              Conclusions:                    The cessation of oral PrEP among MSM in China is associated with various factors, including the cost of oral PrEP medication, regimens, individual perception of HIV risk, stigma, and the quality of medical services. It is recommended to provide appropriate regimens for eligible MSM and develop tailored combinations of strategies to enhance PrEP awareness and acceptance among individuals, medical staff, and the MSM community. The findings from this study can support the refinement of HIV interventions among MSM in China, contributing to efforts to reduce the burden of HIV in this population.

"abstract": "Abstract                        Background:                    Pregnant women are a vulnerable population to COVID-19 given an increased susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and pregnancy complications. However, few SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys have been performed among this population to assess the extent of the infection in sub-Saharan countries. The objectives of this study were to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among Beninese pregnant women, to identify spatial seropositivity clusters and to analyse factors associated with the infection.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional study including women in their third trimester of pregnancy attending the antenatal care (ANC) clinics at Allada (south Benin) and Natitingou (north Benin) was conducted. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for detection of IgG/IgM against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were performed using capillary blood. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and associations between SARS-CoV-2 serostatus and maternal characteristics were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Spatial analyses were performed using the spatial scan statistics to identify spatial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infection.              Results:                    A total of 861 pregnant women were enrolled between May 4 and June 29, 2022. 58/861 (6.7%) participants reported having received COVID-19 vaccine. None of the participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19 during their pregnancy. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 607/802 (75.7%; 95% CI 72.56%-78.62%) of unvaccinated participants. Several urban and rural spatial clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were identified in Allada and one urban spatial cluster was identified in Natitingou. Unvaccinated participants from Allada with at least one previous morbidity were at a three-times higher risk of presenting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (OR = 2.89; 95%CI 1.19%-7.00%).              Conclusion:                    Three out of four pregnant women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggesting a high virus circulation among pregnant women in Benin, while COVID-19 vaccination coverage was low. Pregnant women with comorbidities may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Even though women have a higher life expectancy and slower age-related muscle mass loss than men, they often show a higher prevalence of limitations in physical functioning. However, the reasons behind these sex differences are still unclear. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate sex differences among older adults regarding physical functioning and to study which factors are explaining these sex differences.              Methods:                    Cross-sectional data from participants of the OUTDOOR ACTIVE study residing in Bremen, Germany, aged 65 to 75 years, were included in the analyses. Physical functioning was assessed via a self-administered questionnaire using the SF-36 10-item Physical Functioning Scale. Social, lifestyle, and health-related factors were also assessed using the questionnaire. Physical activity was measured objectively using wrist-worn accelerometers over seven consecutive days. Descriptive analyses with absolute and relative frequencies, means and standard deviations, as well as T-tests and chi-square tests were carried out. To test for associations between sex, physical functioning, and several individual factors, linear regressions were performed.              Results:                    Data of 2 141 participants (52.1% female) were included in the study. Women and men showed statistically significant differences in physical functioning, with men perceiving fewer limitations than women. On average, women had a physical functioning score of 81.4 \u00b1 19.3 and men 86.7 \u00b1 17.0. Linear regression showed a statistically significant negative association between physical functioning score and sex (\u03b2: -0.15, 95% CL: -0.19, -0.10). The association remained statistically significant when adding individual factors to the model. All factors together were only able to explain 51% of the physical functioning-sex association with health indicators and the presence of chronic diseases being the most influential factors.              Conclusions:                    We found sex differences in physical functioning, with older women having more limitations than older men. The results showed that health-related factors and chronic diseases played the biggest roles in the different physical functioning scores of women and men.

A lack of understanding about snake and scorpion species and their distribution exacerbates the disabilities and fatalities caused by SBE and SSE. In Sudan, particularly in regions affected by ongoing conflicts where healthcare resources are scarce, social media platforms offer a cost-effective approach to addressing public health challenges. Our aim in this study is to highlight the benefits of using social media for data collection and health promotion in such environments.              Methods:                    We present a cost-effective communication and data collection strategy implemented at the Toxic Organisms Research Centre (TORC) of the University of Khartoum, focusing on a Facebook group, #QUOTE#Scorpions and Snakes of Sudan#QUOTE#, as our primary social media platform. Additionally, we discuss the lessons learned and the initial impact of this strategy on enhancing population health literacy.              Results:                    The group community is composed of ~ 5000 members from 14 countries. During the period from January 2023 to January 2024, we received 417 enquiries about snakes and scorpions belonging to 11 families and composed of 55 species. In addition, 53 other enquiries covered a range of organisms and their tracks (e.g., spiders, skinks, chameleons, foxes, sun spiders, centipedes, lizards, moth larvae, and insect tracks). The first photographic evidence of Malpolon monspessulanus in Sudan was via the group activities. The rare species Telescopus gezirae, the Blue Nile cat snake, is also documented via the group member#QUOTE#s queries. Recognizing the evolving nature of social media use in public health, we also address the current limitations and evidence gaps that need to be addressed to effectively translate best practices into policy.              Conclusion:                    In conclusion, utilizing Facebook as an institutional platform to share scientific information in simple Arabic language underscores the proactive roles that citizens, scientists, and public health stakeholders can play in leveraging social media for eHealth, eAwareness, and public health initiatives. This approach highlights the potential for collaborative efforts, particularly during crises, to maximize the benefits of social media in advancing public health.

Gastroenteritis outbreaks caused by norovirus in educational institutions were the prominent cause of Public Health Emergency Events in China. This study aimed to explore the transformation in the contribution of KAP items related to outbreak prevention before and after intervention and the impact of demography factors on the intervention.              Methods:                    This study sampled 1095 kindergarten and 1028 school staff in Shenzhen, China. We created a questionnaire consisting of 35 items in 4 parts, and each item was rated on a scale of 1-5 according to the accuracy. Univariate analysis of non-parametric tests and binary logistic regression were used to estimate the score difference on demographic characteristics, each item and KAP. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence and intervals (CI) for the association between statistical indicators were mainly used to explain the effects before and after intervention.              Results:                    Overall, 98.72% and 74.9% of the kindergarten and school participants were female, and all respondents had the highest scores difference of practice. Following intervention, univariate analysis indicated that primary school and female respondents achieved higher knowledge scores. Staff age beyond 35 (OR = 0.56, CI:0.34-0.92; OR = 0.67, CI:0.50-0.90) and with more than ten years of service (OR = 0.58, CI:0.36-0.91; OR = 0.38, CI:0.17-0.84) demonstrated a significantly lower post-intervention score for attitude and practice in both kindergartens and schools. The staff members exhibited a general lack of familiarity with the transmission of aerosols and the seasonal patterns of NoVs diarrhea pandemics. Item analysis revealed that kindergarten staff aged 26 and above demonstrated superior performance in terms of the efficacy of medical alcohol for inactivation (OR = 1.93, CI:1.13-3.31) and management strategies for unexplained vomiting among students (OR = 1.97, CI:1.21-3.18). Private school personnel displayed more significant improvement in their practices following educational interventions. School administrators#QUOTE# negative attitudes were primarily evident in their perspectives on morning inspections (OR = 0.11, CI:0.05-0.84).              Conclusions:                    The potential negative impact of faculty age on NoVs-related knowledge can be mitigated by the positive attitudes fostered through seniority. Furthermore, it is imperative to urgently address the lack of knowledge among administrators, and the identification and treatment of vomiting symptoms should be emphasized as crucial aspects of school prevention strategies. Therefore, education authorities should implement comprehensive public health interventions in the future.

People living with physical disabilities were deemed to be at greater risk of complications following COVID-19 infection and were subjected to stricter social distancing guidelines. But gaps remain in our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions affected the ability to access support, health and wellbeing of people with physical disabilities. Such understanding is vital to ensure equitable future pandemic preparedness for people living with physical disabilities.              Methods:                    We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 31 people living in the UK between May 2020 and January 2022. All participants self-identified as having a physical disability that affected their mobility, sight, or hearing. We analysed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.              Results:                    Six themes were identified that described the impact of the pandemic on ability to access support, health and wellbeing: (i) adaptations to healthcare provision led to difficulties in managing health and wellbeing; (ii) exacerbations of inequalities in access to public space due to social distancing guidelines; (iii) experiences of hostility from able-bodied people; (iv) loss of social lives and encounters; (v) difficulties maintaining distance from others and subsequent fear of infection and (vi) strategies to support wellbeing and coping when confined to the home.              Conclusion:                    The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health and social inequalities experienced by disabled people. The disproportionate impact of the pandemic on service provision and social connections resulted in challenging circumstances for disabled people who faced unmet medical needs, deteriorating health, and at times, hostile public spaces.

Studies on weight stigma in adolescence, particularly from general populations, are scarce in the Mediterranean area. The main aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of experienced and internalized weight stigma among a representative sample of adolescents from the Spanish city of Terrassa, and to determine its association with sociodemographic variables and weight status.              Methods:                    Drawing on data from the initial assessment of a longitudinally funded project on weight stigma in adolescents, a cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted using random multistage cluster sampling. Weight stigma experiences, their frequency and sources, and weight bias internalization with the Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBISM) were assessed in a sample of 1016 adolescents. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) between sociodemographic variables, weight status and having experienced weight stigma, and having reported high scores of WBISM (WBISM \u2265 4) were estimated by multiple logistic regression models.              Results:                    The prevalence of weight-related stigma experiences was 43.2% in the sample (81.8 in adolescents with obesity) and the prevalence of high levels of weight bias internalization was 19.4% (50.7 in adolescents with obesity). Other kids and school were the most prevalent sources of weight stigma, with society and family being other significant sources of stigma reported by girls. A significantly higher risk of having experienced weight stigma was observed in girls (AOR = 2.6) and in older adolescents (AOR = 1.9). Compared to normal weight adolescents, all weight statuses showed higher risk, being 3.4 times higher in adolescents with underweight and reaching 11.4 times higher risk in those with obesity. Regarding high levels of weight bias internalization, girls had a risk 6.6 times higher than boys. Once again, a #QUOTE#J-shaped#QUOTE# pattern was observed, with a higher risk at the lowest and highest weight statuses. The risk was 6.3 times higher in adolescents with underweight, and 13.1 times higher in adolescents with obesity compared to those with normal weight.              Conclusions:                    Considering the high prevalence of experienced and internalized weight stigma among adolescents in Spain, especially in adolescents with obesity and girls, it seems important to implement preventive strategies in different settings and address all sources of stigma.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine fishers#QUOTE# mobility history, prevalence of loneliness, predictors of loneliness, effects of loneliness on fishers, coping strategies to address loneliness, and prevalence of risky behaviour among fishers in Elmina, Ghana.              Methods:                    This is a convergent parallel mixed-method study involving 385 fishers in Elmina. A questionnaire and interview guides were used to collect data from respondents. Descriptive statistics, Pearson#QUOTE#s chi-square and Fisher exact tests, and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the quantitative data, while the qualitative data were analysed thematically.              Results:                    From the quantitative findings, most fishers were mobile (54.5%) and travelled alone (45.7%). Approximately 83% of the fishers experienced loneliness. Male fishers (AOR = 0.049; 95% CI = 0.003-0.741; p-value = 0.030), fishers affiliated with the African Traditionalist religion (AOR = 0.043; 95% CI = 0.002-0.846; p-value = 0.038), and fishers who travelled with their working colleagues (AOR = 0.002; 95% CI = 0.000-0.023; p-value = \u2264 0.001), were less likely to be experience loneliness. Feeling bored, isolated and worried/anxious were the main perceived effects of loneliness. Alcohol consumption and finding a companion to spend time with were the main strategies fishers used to cope with their loneliness. Most male fishers consumed alcohol (92.5%; p-value = \u2264 0.001) and spent time with companions (73.5%; p-value = \u2264 0.001) to cope with their loneliness. The quantitative and qualitative findings showed that fishers engaged in risky behaviours (excessive alcohol consumption, casual sex, and smoking marijuana and tobacco). From the quantitative findings, more male fishers engaged in excessive alcohol consumption (97.6% vs. 74.5%; p-value = \u2264 0.001), casual sex (88.2% vs. 61.7%, p-value = \u2264 0.001), smoking marijuana (43.0% vs. 13.0%, p-value = \u2264 0.001) and tobacco (49.4% vs. 19.1%; p-value = 0.001) than female fishers.              Conclusions:                    Loneliness and risky behaviours were common among fishers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design interventions to help reduce loneliness and risky behaviour among fishers.

No previous Canadian data has estimated child exposure to food marketing across digital media platforms. This study aimed to compare the frequency, healthfulness and power of food marketing viewed by children and adolescents across all digital platforms in Canada.              Methods:                    For this cross-sectional study, a quota sample of 100 youth aged 6-17 years old (50 children, 50 adolescents distributed equally by sex) were recruited online and in-person in Canada in 2022. Each participant completed the WHO screen capture protocol where they were recorded using their smartphone or tablet for 30-min in an online Zoom session. Research assistants identified all instances of food marketing in the captured video footage. A content analysis of each marketing instance was then completed to examine the use of marketing techniques. Nutritional data were collected on each product viewed and healthfulness was determined using Health Canada#QUOTE#s 2018 Nutrient Profile Model. Estimated daily and yearly exposure to food marketing was calculated using self-reported device usage data.              Results:                    51% of youth were exposed to food marketing. On average, we estimated that children are exposed to 1.96 marketing instances/child/30-min (4067 marketing instances/child/year) and adolescents are exposed to 2.56 marketing instances/adolescent/30-min (8301 marketing instances/adolescent/year). Both children and adolescents were most exposed on social media platforms (83%), followed by mobile games (13%). Both age groups were most exposed to fast food (22% of marketing instances) compared to other food categories. Nearly 90% of all marketing instances were considered less healthy according to Health Canada#QUOTE#s proposed 2018 Nutrient Profile Model, and youth-appealing marketing techniques such as graphic effects and music were used frequently.              Conclusions:                    Using the WHO screen capture protocol, we were able to determine that child and adolescent exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods across digital media platforms is likely high.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of Physical Literacy (PL) on Negative Mental State caused by COVID-19 (NMSC) and identify potential factors related to NMSC and PL in Chinese adolescents. This cross-sectional study involved a total of 729 Chinese high school students with an average age of 16.2 \u00b1 1.1 years. Participants#QUOTE# demographic data, PL data, and NMSC data were collected. PL and NMSC were measured using the self-reported Portuguese Physical Literacy Assessment Questionnaire (PPLA-Q), the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 (SAVE-6), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19). Adolescents in the current study demonstrated higher levels of NMSC and lower PL, with average scores of 3.45 and 2.26, respectively (on a scale of 5). Through multiple linear regression analysis, Motivation (MO), Confidence (CO), Emotional Regulation (ER), and Physical Regulation (PR) were identified as factors influencing NMSC in adolescents. The study findings contribute to providing guidance for actions aimed at alleviating NMSC among adolescents.

We determined the effect of a school-based food and nutrition education (SFNE) intervention on the nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes, dietary habits, physical activity levels and the anthropometric indices (BMI-for-age z scores, %Body fat and waist circumference) of school-age children in northern Ghana.              Methods:                    Following a controlled before-and-after study design, we recruited school-age children in primary 4 and 5 from public and private schools and assigned them non-randomly to intervention and control groups (4 schools total). A SFNE intervention called #QUOTE#Eat Healthy, Grow Healthy (EHGH)#QUOTE# was implemented in intervention schools. Components of the intervention included children, teachers, school officials, and the school environment. Nutrition education didactic sessions, active discussions, nutrition games, charades, art work, and physical activity sessions were among the teaching and learning activities implemented. At 0 and 6 months, primary (anthropometry) and secondary (fruit, vegetable, and breakfast consumption) outcomes were obtained.              Results:                    Mean BMI-for-age z-scores did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups (F1,261 = 0.45, P = 0.503, \u03b72 = 0.01). However, significantly greater nutrition-related knowledge scores were recorded in the intervention group than in the control group at post-intervention (M = 6.07 SD = 2.17 vs. M = 5.22 SD = 1.92; p = 0.002). Mean number of days intervention children consumed fruits differed across time (F1, 263 = 33.04, p = 0.002, \u03b72 = 0.04) but not between the control and intervention groups (F1, 263 = 0.28, p = 0.60, \u03b72 = 0.00).              Conclusions:                    The EHGH intervention had positive effects on the nutrition-related knowledge and the consumption of fruits among children although it did not impact their anthropometric indices.

One of the most effective ways of obesity treatment is bariatric surgery. This study was conducted aiming to determine and compare sexual self-concept in women with obesity pre- and post-bariatric surgery.              Method:                    A longitudinal study comparing sexual self-concept pre and post- surgery was conducted on women with obesity referring to obesity clinics in the city of Tehran in 2020-2021. Data collection was performed using Snell#QUOTE#s Multidimensional Sexual Self-Concept Questionnaire (MSSCQ), which was completed online. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16 statistical software and Fisher#QUOTE#s exact test, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, independent t, and logistic and linear regression tests. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.              Results:                    According to the findings, the mean (standard deviation) score of sexual self-concept was 240.26 (26.82) in the post-surgery group and 200.26 (32.24) in the pre-surgery group (P = 0.001), and the highest mean (standard deviation) score of sexual self-concept both in the pre-surgery group (13.06 [4.00]) and in the post-surgery group (15.46 [2.16]) was related to the area of sexual depression (P = 0.05). Also, with increasing educational level, the odds of bariatric surgery increased by 33%, and those who had no private bedroom had lower odds of bariatric surgery by 65%. In those who did not have other individuals living in their house and their spouse was not a smoker, the self-concept score was 52.35 and 23.11 units higher.              Conclusion:                    In general, bariatric surgery can improve sexual self-care. Considering the issue of sexual self-concept in bariatric surgery, it is recommended to design appropriate counseling and planning before surgery according to the culture of each country.

The main aim of this project is to measure health literacy in the adult population living in the municipality of Leiria over the next 10 years. As secondary objectives it is intended to characterize anxiety and depression, metabolic risk and health behaviors in the same population and over the same period.              Methods:                    This is a prospective cohort study that collects data on HL, anxiety and depression, health characteristics, health behavior and sociodemographic data. The study population will be composed by adults (\u2265 18 years old) who are non-institutionalized and living in private households in Leiria. The random sample is stratified by gender and age groups. A face-to-face interview will be conducted with the Computer Assisted Personal Interview at baseline. Follow-up will be carried out every 2 years via telephone call. The association between independent variables and health literacy is examined by means of variance analysis with measurement repetition, and taking into consideration follow-up.              Discussion:                    The LiSa project is a population-based study, derived from a random sampling technique that will allow the analysis of health outcomes in a representative sample of the population of the municipality of Leiria. The LiSa study will be a valuable resource for epidemiological research, as it will provide fundamental information to improve public health policies regarding health literacy in Portugal.

This study examined the prevalence and risk factors of food insecurity among Syrian refugees living in Istanbul, which has the highest number of refugees in T\u00fcrkiye.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Syrian refugees in Istanbul between September 2021 and March 2022. The main income earners of 103 households were interviewed by a research dietitian, with the assistance of an Arabic speaking interpreter through hour-long face-to-face. Data on sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, nationality, marital status, educational status, the family income, the major source of family income, and the number of family members living in the household etc.) and household food insecurity status were collected. Household food insecurity status was assessed with the eighteen-item Household Food Security Survey Module.              Results:                    The household food insecurity rate was 90.3%, and those of adults and children were 88.4% and 84.8%, respectively. It was observed that family income level was significantly associated with food insecurity. A one-unit increase in monthly income increased food security by 0.02 times (p < 0.001). The number of employed refugees in the food security group was higher than that in the food insecurity group (p = 0.018). A significant difference was found in the rate of occupation type of the major income earner between the groups (p = 0.046).              Conclusions:                    High rates of food insecurity, particularly severe food insecurity, were found among Syrian refugees living in Istanbul. While more research is warranted to explore the root causes and efficacy of the current support system, it requires the immediate attention of policymakers at the national and international levels to implement effective policies and interventions.
