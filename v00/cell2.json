Our study analyzed co-signaling receptors during hepatocellular priming and traced the trajectory and fate of dysfunctional HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Early on, these cells upregulate PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, OX40, 4-1BB, and ICOS. While blocking co-inhibitory receptors had minimal effect, activating 4-1BB and OX40 converted them into antiviral effectors. Prolonged stimulation led to a self-renewing, long-lived, heterogeneous population with a unique transcriptional profile. This includes dysfunctional progenitor/stem-like (TSL) cells and two distinct dysfunctional tissue-resident memory (TRM) populations. While 4-1BB expression is ubiquitously maintained, OX40 expression is limited to TSL. In chronic settings, only 4-1BB stimulation conferred antiviral activity. In HBeAg+ chronic patients, 4-1BB activation showed the highest potential to rejuvenate dysfunctional CD8+ T cells. Targeting all dysfunctional T cells, rather than only stem-like precursors, holds promise for treating chronic HBV infection.

We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate transgenic locusts expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages. Mechanistically, this unconventional spatial olfactory code reflects the locust-specific and multiplexed glomerular innervation pattern of the antennal lobe.

The >66,000 rove beetle species (Staphylinidae) form the largest metazoan family. Combining genomic and cell type transcriptomic insights spanning the largest clade, Aleocharinae, we retrace evolution of two cell types comprising a defensive gland-a putative catalyst behind staphylinid megadiversity. We identify molecular evolutionary steps leading to benzoquinone production by one cell type via a mechanism convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis by the second cell type of a solvent that weaponizes the total secretion. This cooperative system has been conserved since the Early Cretaceous as Aleocharinae radiated into tens of thousands of lineages.

Although severe infections profoundly alter host metabolism, prior studies have largely ignored microbial metabolism in this context. Here, we describe an iterative, comparative metabolomics pipeline to uncover microbial metabolic features in the complex setting of a host and apply it to investigate gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients. We find elevated levels of bacterially derived acetylated polyamines during BSI and discover the enzyme responsible for their production (SpeG). Blocking SpeG activity reduces bacterial proliferation and slows pathogenesis. Reduction of SpeG activity also enhances bacterial membrane permeability and increases intracellular antibiotic accumulation, allowing us to overcome AMR in culture and in vivo. This study highlights how tools to study pathogen metabolism in the natural context of infection can reveal and prioritize therapeutic strategies for addressing challenging infections.

By dissecting the neuronal inflammatory stress response, we discovered that neurons in MS and its mouse model induce the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). However, activation of neuronal STING requires its detachment from the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a process triggered by glutamate excitotoxicity. This detachment initiates non-canonical STING signaling, which leads to autophagic degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), essential for neuronal redox homeostasis and thereby inducing ferroptosis. Both genetic and pharmacological interventions that target STING in neurons protect against inflammation-induced neurodegeneration. Our findings position STING as a central regulator of the detrimental neuronal inflammatory stress response, integrating inflammation with glutamate signaling to cause neuronal cell death, and present it as a tractable target for treating neurodegeneration in MS.

Therefore, we screened for NLRC5#QUOTE#s role in response to infections, PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines. We identified that NLRC5 acts as an innate immune sensor to drive inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in response to specific ligands, including PAMP/heme and heme/cytokine combinations. NLRC5 interacted with NLRP12 and PANoptosome components to form a cell death complex, suggesting an NLR network forms similar to those in plants.

Pathogens binding to host extracellular proteins (the #QUOTE#exoproteome#QUOTE#) represents a crucial interface in the etiology of vector-borne disease. Here, we used bacterial selection to elucidate host-microbe interactions in high throughput (BASEHIT)-a technique enabling interrogation of microbial interactions with 3,324 human exoproteins-to profile the interactomes of 82 human-pathogen samples, including 30 strains of arthropod-borne pathogens and 8 strains of related non-vector-borne pathogens. The resulting atlas revealed 1,303 putative interactions, including hundreds of pairings with potential roles in pathogenesis, including cell invasion, tissue colonization, immune evasion, and host sensing. Subsequent functional investigations uncovered that Lyme disease spirochetes recognize epidermal growth factor as an environmental cue of transcriptional regulation and that conserved interactions between intracellular pathogens and thioredoxins facilitate cell invasion. In summary, this interactome atlas provides molecular-level insights into microbial pathogenesis and reveals potential host-directed targets for next-generation therapeutics.

In this study, we found that PD-1 and CTLA4-based cancer immunotherapies are unable to eradicate tumors in elderly mice. This defect in anti-tumor activity correlated with two known age-associated immune defects: diminished abundance of systemic naive CD8+ T cells and weak migratory activities of dendritic cells (DCs). We identified a vaccine adjuvant, referred to as a DC hyperactivator, which corrects DC migratory defects in the elderly. Vaccines containing tumor antigens and DC hyperactivators induced T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells with cytolytic activity that drive anti-tumor immunity in elderly mice. When administered early in life, DC hyperactivators were the only adjuvant identified that elicited anti-tumor CD4+ T cells that persisted into old age. These results raise the possibility of correcting age-associated immune defects through DC manipulation.

Replication initiation entails the assembly and activation of two CMG helicases (Cdc45\u22c5Mcm2-7\u22c5GINS) at each origin. This requires several replication firing factors (including TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON) whose exact roles are still under debate. How two helicases are correctly assembled and activated at each origin is a long-standing question. By visualizing the recruitment of GINS, Cdc45, TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON in real time, we uncovered that replication initiation is surprisingly dynamic. First, TopBP1 transiently binds to the origin and dissociates before the start of DNA synthesis. Second, two Cdc45 are recruited together, even though Cdc45 alone cannot dimerize. Next, two copies of DONSON and two GINS simultaneously arrive at the origin, completing the assembly of two CMG helicases. Finally, RecQL4 is recruited to the CMG\u22c5DONSON\u22c5DONSON\u22c5CMG complex and promotes DONSON dissociation and CMG activation via its ATPase activity.

Here, we show that anaerobic archaea encode diverse, active, and ancient lineages of [FeFe] hydrogenases through combining analysis of existing and new genomes with extensive biochemical experiments. [FeFe] hydrogenases are encoded by genomes of nine archaeal phyla and expressed by H2-producing Asgard archaeon cultures. We report an ultraminimal hydrogenase in DPANN archaea that binds the catalytic H-cluster and produces H2. Moreover, we identify and characterize remarkable hybrid complexes formed through the fusion of [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases in ten other archaeal orders. Phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling suggest a deep evolutionary history of hybrid hydrogenases. These findings reveal new metabolic adaptations of archaea, streamlined H2 catalysts for biotechnological development, and a surprisingly intertwined evolutionary history between the two major H2-metabolizing enzymes.

However, an unresolved challenge is the extensive cell death following transplantation. Here, we performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screen to enhance postmitotic dopamine neuron survival in vivo. We identified p53-mediated apoptotic cell death as a major contributor to dopamine neuron loss and uncovered a causal link of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in limiting cell survival. As a translationally relevant strategy to purify postmitotic dopamine neurons, we identified cell surface markers that enable purification without the need for genetic reporters. Combining cell sorting and treatment with adalimumab, a clinically approved TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, enabled efficient engraftment of postmitotic dopamine neurons with extensive reinnervation and functional recovery in a preclinical PD mouse model. Thus, transient TNF-\u03b1 inhibition presents a clinically relevant strategy to enhance survival and enable engraftment of postmitotic hPSC-derived dopamine neurons in PD.

To enable systematic exploration of how receptor valency and geometry affect signaling outcomes, we designed cyclic homo-oligomers with up to 8 subunits using repeat protein building blocks that can be modularly extended. By incorporating a de novo-designed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding module into these scaffolds, we generated a series of synthetic signaling ligands that exhibit potent valency- and geometry-dependent Ca2+ release and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. The high specificity of the designed agonists reveals distinct roles for two FGFR splice variants in driving arterial endothelium and perivascular cell fates during early vascular development.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial membrane remodeling and quality control to mtDNA copy number (CN) regulation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1) negatively regulates IMM fusion. Moreover, manipulation of mitochondrial fusion through the regulation of MTFP1 levels results in mtDNA CN modulation. Mechanistically, we found that MTFP1 inhibits mitochondrial fusion to isolate and exclude damaged IMM subdomains from the rest of the network. Subsequently, peripheral fission ensures their segregation into small MTFP1-enriched mitochondria (SMEM) that are targeted for degradation in an autophagic-dependent manner. Remarkably, MTFP1-dependent IMM quality control is essential for basal nucleoid recycling and therefore to maintain adequate mtDNA levels within the cell.

However, previous studies have indicated that Lgr5+ cells are dispensable for intestinal regeneration, leading to two major hypotheses: one favoring the presence of a quiescent reserve ISC and the other calling for differentiated cell plasticity. To investigate these possibilities, we studied crypt epithelial cells in an unbiased fashion via high-resolution single-cell profiling. These studies, combined with in vivo lineage tracing, show that Lgr5 is not a specific ISC marker and that stemness potential exists beyond the crypt base and resides in the isthmus region, where undifferentiated cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and regeneration following irradiation (IR) injury. Our results provide an alternative model of intestinal epithelial cell organization, suggesting that stemness potential is not restricted to CBC cells, and neither de-differentiation nor reserve ISC are drivers of intestinal regeneration.

Here, we identify a proliferative upper crypt population marked by Fgfbp1, in the location of putative TA cells, that is transcriptionally distinct from Lgr5+ cells. Using a kinetic reporter for time-resolved fate mapping and Fgfbp1-CreERT2 lineage tracing, we establish that Fgfbp1+ cells are multi-potent and give rise to Lgr5+ cells, consistent with their ISC function. Fgfbp1+ cells also sustain epithelial regeneration following Lgr5+ cell depletion. We demonstrate that FGFBP1, produced by the upper crypt cells, is an essential factor for crypt proliferation and epithelial homeostasis. Our findings support a model in which tissue regeneration originates from upper crypt Fgfbp1+ cells that generate progeny propagating bi-directionally along the crypt-villus axis and serve as a source of Lgr5+ cells in the crypt base.

However, the relative contributions, timing, and regulation of these pathways in determining cell fate is unclear. Here we use time-resolved phosphoproteomic, chemical-genetic, single-cell imaging, and biochemical approaches to create a chronological atlas of signaling events activated in cells responding to UV damage. We discover that UV-induced apoptosis is mediated by the RSR kinase ZAK and not through the DDR. We identify two negative-feedback modules that regulate ZAK-mediated apoptosis: (1) GCN2 activation limits ribosomal collisions and attenuates ZAK-mediated RSR and (2) ZAK activity leads to phosphodegron autophosphorylation and its subsequent degradation. These events tune ZAK#QUOTE#s activity to collision levels to establish regimes of homeostasis, tolerance, and death, revealing its key role as the cellular sentinel for nucleic acid damage.

In human 8-cell blastomeres, zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs to initiate the ontogenesis program. However, capturing and maintaining totipotency in human cells pose significant challenges. Here, we realize culturing human totipotent blastomere-like cells (hTBLCs). We find that splicing inhibition can transiently reprogram human pluripotent stem cells into ZGA-like cells (ZLCs), which subsequently transition into stable hTBLCs after long-term passaging. Distinct from reported 8-cell-like cells (8CLCs), both ZLCs and hTBLCs widely silence pluripotent genes. Interestingly, ZLCs activate a particular group of ZGA-specific genes, and hTBLCs are enriched with pre-ZGA-specific genes. During spontaneous differentiation, hTBLCs re-enter the intermediate ZLC stage and further generate epiblast (EPI)-, primitive endoderm (PrE)-, and trophectoderm (TE)-like lineages, effectively recapitulating human pre-implantation development. Possessing both embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potency, hTBLCs can autonomously generate blastocyst-like structures in vitro without external cell signaling. In summary, our study provides key criteria and insights into human cell totipotency.

We predicted 130 active DNA TEs from 102 metazoan genomes and evaluated their activity in human cells. We identified 40 active (integration-competent) TEs, surpassing the cumulative number (20) of TEs found previously. With this unified comparative data, we found that the Tc1/mariner superfamily exhibits elevated activity, potentially explaining their pervasive horizontal transfers. Further functional characterization of TEs revealed additional divergence in features such as insertion bias. Remarkably, in CAR-T therapy for hematological and solid tumors, Mariner2_AG (MAG), the most active DNA TE identified, largely outperformed two widely used vectors, the lentiviral vector and the TE-based vector SB100X.

We associated CHIP-DNMT3A mutations with a higher prevalence of periodontitis and gingival inflammation among 4,946 community-dwelling adults. To model DNMT3A-driven CHIP, we used mice with the heterozygous loss-of-function mutation R878H, equivalent to the human hotspot mutation R882H. Partial transplantation with Dnmt3aR878H/+ bone marrow (BM) cells resulted in clonal expansion of mutant cells into both myeloid and lymphoid lineages and an elevated abundance of osteoclast precursors in the BM and osteoclastogenic macrophages in the periphery. DNMT3A-driven clonal hematopoiesis in recipient mice promoted naturally occurring periodontitis and aggravated experimentally induced periodontitis and arthritis, associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis, IL-17-dependent inflammation and neutrophil responses, and impaired regulatory T cell immunosuppressive activity.

The ForceChrono probe circumvents the limitations of in vitro single-molecule force spectroscopy by enabling direct measurements within the dynamic cellular environment.

At telomeres, Pol\u03b1/primase is bound to Ctc1/Stn1/Ten1 (CST), a single-stranded DNA-binding complex. Like mutations in telomerase, mutations affecting CST-Pol\u03b1/primase result in pathological telomere shortening and cause a telomere biology disorder, Coats plus (CP). We determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human CST bound to the shelterin heterodimer POT1/TPP1 that reveal how CST is recruited to telomeres by POT1. Our findings suggest that POT1 hinge phosphorylation is required for CST recruitment, and the complex is formed through conserved interactions involving several residues mutated in CP. Our structural and biochemical data suggest that phosphorylated POT1 holds CST-Pol\u03b1/primase in an inactive, autoinhibited state until telomerase has extended the telomere ends.

To synthesize purines, cells use two principal routes: the de novo and salvage pathways. Traditionally, it is believed that proliferating cells predominantly rely on de novo synthesis, whereas differentiated tissues favor the salvage pathway. Unexpectedly, we find that adenine and inosine are the most effective circulating precursors for supplying purine nucleotides to tissues and tumors, while hypoxanthine is rapidly catabolized and poorly salvaged in vivo. Quantitative metabolic analysis demonstrates comparative contribution from de novo synthesis and salvage pathways in maintaining purine nucleotide pools in tumors. Notably, feeding mice nucleotides accelerates tumor growth, while inhibiting purine salvage slows down tumor progression, revealing a crucial role of the salvage pathway in tumor metabolism. These findings provide fundamental insights into how normal tissues and tumors maintain purine nucleotides and highlight the significance of purine salvage in cancer.

It is commonly thought to be directly produced from polyprenol by the enzyme SRD5A3. Instead, we found that dolichol synthesis requires a three-step detour involving additional metabolites, where SRD5A3 catalyzes only the second reaction. The first and third steps are performed by DHRSX, whose gene resides on the pseudoautosomal regions of the X and Y chromosomes. Accordingly, we report a pseudoautosomal-recessive disease presenting as a congenital disorder of glycosylation in patients with missense variants in DHRSX (DHRSX-CDG). Of note, DHRSX has a unique dual substrate and cofactor specificity, allowing it to act as a NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase and as a NADPH-dependent reductase in two non-consecutive steps. Thus, our work reveals unexpected complexity in the terminal steps of dolichol biosynthesis. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanism by which dolichol metabolism defects contribute to disease.

However, how Suv39 proteins are nucleated at heterochromatin is not fully described. In the fission yeast, current models posit that Argonaute1-associated small RNAs (sRNAs) nucleate the sole H3K9 methyltransferase, Clr4/SUV39H, to centromeres. Here, we show that in the absence of all sRNAs and H3K9me, the Mtl1 and Red1 core (MTREC)/PAXT complex nucleates Clr4/SUV39H at a heterochromatic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) at which the two H3K9 deacetylases, Sir2 and Clr3, also accumulate by distinct mechanisms. Iterative cycles of H3K9 deacetylation and methylation spread Clr4/SUV39H from the nucleation center in an sRNA-independent manner, generating a basal H3K9me state. This is acted upon by the RNAi machinery to augment and amplify the Clr4/H3K9me signal at centromeres to establish heterochromatin. Overall, our data reveal that lncRNAs and RNA quality control factors can nucleate heterochromatin and function as epigenetic silencers in eukaryotes.

Small molecules that improve CFTR folding (correctors) or function (potentiators) are clinically available. However, the only potentiator, ivacaftor, has suboptimal pharmacokinetics and inhibitors have yet to be clinically developed. Here, we combine molecular docking, electrophysiology, cryo-EM, and medicinal chemistry to identify CFTR modulators. We docked \u223c155 million molecules into the potentiator site on CFTR, synthesized 53 test ligands, and used structure-based optimization to identify candidate modulators.

Here, using two Brassicaceae species, Crucihimalaya himalaica and Erysimum nevadense, as polycarpic perennial models, we reveal that the transition from polycarpic perennial to biennial and annual flowering behavior is a continuum determined by the dosage of three closely related MADS-box genes. Diversification of the expression patterns, functional strengths, and combinations of these genes endows species with the potential to adopt various life-history strategies. Remarkably, we find that a single gene among these three is sufficient to convert winter-annual or annual Brassicaceae plants into polycarpic perennial flowering plants.

The African turquoise killifish has evolved diapause as a form of suspended development to survive a complete drought. However, the mechanisms underlying the evolution of extreme survival states are unknown. To understand diapause evolution, we performed integrative multi-omics (gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and lipidomics) in the embryos of multiple killifish species. We find that diapause evolved by a recent remodeling of regulatory elements at very ancient gene duplicates (paralogs) present in all vertebrates. CRISPR-Cas9-based perturbations identify the transcription factors REST/NRSF and FOXOs as critical for the diapause gene expression program, including genes involved in lipid metabolism. Indeed, diapause shows a distinct lipid profile, with an increase in triglycerides with very-long-chain fatty acids. Our work suggests a mechanism for the evolution of complex adaptations and offers strategies to promote long-term survival by activating suspended animation programs in other species.

Here, we show that the human gut bacteria Gordonibacter pamelaeae and Eggerthella lenta convert abundant biliary corticoids into progestins through 21-dehydroxylation, thereby transforming a class of immuno- and metabo-regulatory steroids into a class of sex hormones and neurosteroids. Using comparative genomics, homologous expression, and heterologous expression, we identify a bacterial gene cluster that performs 21-dehydroxylation. We also uncover an unexpected role for hydrogen gas production by gut commensals in promoting 21-dehydroxylation, suggesting that hydrogen modulates secondary metabolism in the gut. Levels of certain bacterial progestins, including allopregnanolone, better known as brexanolone, an FDA-approved drug for postpartum depression, are substantially increased in feces from pregnant humans. Thus, bacterial conversion of corticoids into progestins may affect host physiology, particularly in the context of pregnancy and women#QUOTE#s health.

Turnover occurs across organisms and scales, including for RNAs, proteins, membranes, macromolecular structures, organelles, cells, hair, feathers, nails, antlers, and teeth. For many systems, turnover might seem wasteful when degraded components are often fully functional. Some components turn over with shockingly high rates and others do not turn over at all, further making this process enigmatic. However, turnover can address fundamental problems by yielding powerful properties, including regeneration, rapid repair onset, clearance of unpredictable damage and errors, maintenance of low constitutive levels of disrepair, prevention of stable hazards, and transitions. I argue that trade-offs between turnover benefits and metabolic costs, combined with constraints on turnover, determine its presence and rates across distinct contexts. I suggest that the limits of turnover help explain aging and that turnover properties and the basis for its levels underlie this fundamental component of life."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Celeste M Nelson", "authorLink": "/?term=Nelson+CM&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Bailong Xiao", "authorLink": "/?term=Xiao+B&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Sara A Wickstr\u00f6m", "authorLink": "/?term=Wickstr%C3%B6m+SA&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Yves F Dufr\u00eane", "authorLink": "/?term=Dufr%C3%AAne+YF&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Daniel J Cosgrove", "authorLink": "/?term=Cosgrove+DJ&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Carl-Philipp Heisenberg", "authorLink": "/?term=Heisenberg+CP&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Sirio Dupont", "authorLink": "/?term=Dupont+S&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Amy E Shyer", "authorLink": "/?term=Shyer+AE&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Alan R Rodrigues", "authorLink": "/?term=Rodrigues+AR&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Xavier Trepat", "authorLink": "/?term=Trepat+X&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Alba Diz-Mu\u00f1oz", "authorLink": "/?term=Diz-Mu%C3%B1oz+A&cauthor_id=38788688", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}], "articleTitle": "Mechanobiology: Shaping the future of cellular form and function", "journalTitle": "Cell", "journalLink": "/?term=%22Cell%22%5Bjour%5D&sort=date&sort_order=desc", "cit": "2024 May 23;187(11):2652-2656.", "doi": "doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2024.04.006.", "secondaryDate": null, "grants": [], "abstract": "Abstract                          Mechanobiology-the field studying how cells produce, sense, and respond to mechanical forces-is pivotal in the analysis of how cells and tissues take shape in development and disease.

Moving forward, we anticipate that the observables used to define cell states will evolve again as single-cell imaging and analytics are advancing at a breakneck pace via the collection of large-scale, systematic cell image datasets and the application of quantitative image-based data science methods. This is, therefore, a key moment in the arc of cell biological research to develop approaches that integrate the spatiotemporal observables of the physical structure and organization of the cell with molecular observables toward the concept of a holistic cell state. In this perspective, we propose a conceptual framework for holistic cell states and state transitions that is data-driven, practical, and useful to enable integrative analyses and modeling across many data types."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Peter H Seeberger", "authorLink": "/?term=Seeberger+PH&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Yun Ge", "authorLink": "/?term=Ge+Y&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Christine M Szymanski", "authorLink": "/?term=Szymanski+CM&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Daniel Kolarich", "authorLink": "/?term=Kolarich+D&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Morten Thaysen-Andersen", "authorLink": "/?term=Thaysen-Andersen+M&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Nicolle H Packer", "authorLink": "/?term=Packer+NH&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Elisa Fadda", "authorLink": "/?term=Fadda+E&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Benjamin Davis", "authorLink": "/?term=Davis+B&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Shoko Nishihara", "authorLink": "/?term=Nishihara+S&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Gabriel A Rabinovich", "authorLink": "/?term=Rabinovich+GA&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Peter D Kwong", "authorLink": "/?term=Kwong+PD&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}, {"authorName": "Richard Strasser", "authorLink": "/?term=Strasser+R&cauthor_id=38788686", "affiliationTitle": null, "affiliationLink": null}], "articleTitle": "What comes next in glycobiology", "journalTitle": "Cell", "journalLink": "/?term=%22Cell%22%5Bjour%5D&sort=date&sort_order=desc", "cit": "2024 May 23;187(11):2628-2632.", "doi": "doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2024.04.028.", "secondaryDate": null, "grants": [], "abstract": "Abstract                          Glycans, with their variable compositions and highly dynamic conformations, vastly expand the heterogeneity of whatever factor or cell they are attached to.

However, the wound signal that triggers regenerative responses has not been identified. Here, through characterization of a tomato mutant defective in both wound-induced defense and regeneration, we demonstrate that in tomato, a plant elicitor peptide (Pep), REGENERATION FACTOR1 (REF1), acts as a systemin-independent local wound signal that primarily regulates local defense responses and regenerative responses in response to wounding. We further identified PEPR1/2 ORTHOLOG RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (PORK1) as the receptor perceiving REF1 signal for plant regeneration. REF1-PORK1-mediated signaling promotes regeneration via activating WOUND-INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1), a master regulator of wound-induced cellular reprogramming in plants. Thus, REF1-PORK1 signaling represents a conserved phytocytokine pathway to initiate, amplify, and stabilize a signaling cascade that orchestrates wound-triggered organ regeneration. Application of REF1 provides a simple method to boost the regeneration and transformation efficiency of recalcitrant crops.

However, initial experimentation demonstrated Geobacillus stearothermophilus Cas9 (GeoCas9) to be virtually inactive when used in cultured human cells. Laboratory-evolved variants of GeoCas9 overcome this natural limitation by acquiring mutations in the wedge (WED) domain that produce >100-fold-higher genome-editing levels. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the wild-type and improved GeoCas9 (iGeoCas9) enzymes reveal extended contacts between the WED domain of iGeoCas9 and DNA substrates. Biochemical analysis shows that iGeoCas9 accelerates DNA unwinding to capture substrates under the magnesium-restricted conditions typical of mammalian but not bacterial cells. These findings enabled rational engineering of other Cas9 orthologs to enhance genome-editing levels, pointing to a general strategy for editing enzyme improvement. Together, these results uncover a new role for the Cas9 WED domain in DNA unwinding and demonstrate how accelerated target unwinding dramatically improves Cas9-induced genome-editing activity.

In the intestine, bending of a flat epithelium into a periodic pattern of folds gives rise to villi, finger-like protrusions that enable nutrient absorption. However, the molecular and mechanical processes driving villus morphogenesis remain unclear. Here, we identify an active mechanical mechanism that simultaneously patterns and folds the intestinal epithelium to initiate villus formation. At the cellular level, we find that PDGFRA+ subepithelial mesenchymal cells generate myosin II-dependent forces sufficient to produce patterned curvature in neighboring tissue interfaces. This symmetry-breaking process requires altered cell and extracellular matrix interactions that are enabled by matrix metalloproteinase-mediated tissue fluidization. Computational models, together with in vitro and in vivo experiments, revealed that these cellular features manifest at the tissue level as differences in interfacial tensions that promote mesenchymal aggregation and interface bending through a process analogous to the active dewetting of a thin liquid film.

In this study, we demonstrate that the collective effect of ecological interactions between microbes in a community can be captured by simple statistical models that predict how adding a new species to a community will affect its function. These predictive models mirror the patterns of global epistasis reported in genetics, and they can be quantitatively interpreted in terms of pairwise interactions between community members.

To address this gap, we presented the cultivated gut fungi (CGF) catalog, encompassing 760 fungal genomes derived from the feces of healthy individuals. This catalog comprises 206 species spanning 48 families, including 69 species previously unidentified. We explored the functional and metabolic attributes of the CGF species and utilized this catalog to construct a phylogenetic representation of the gut mycobiome by analyzing over 11,000 fecal metagenomes from Chinese and non-Chinese populations. Moreover, we identified significant common disease-related variations in gut mycobiome composition and corroborated the associations between fungal signatures and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through animal experimentation. These resources and findings substantially enrich our understanding of the biological diversity and disease relevance of the human gut mycobiome.

Whether peripheral sensory neurons innervate the spleen and modulate splenic immune response remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that nociceptive sensory nerve fibers extensively innervate the spleen along blood vessels and reach B cell zones. The spleen-innervating nociceptors predominantly originate from left T8-T13 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), promoting the splenic germinal center (GC) response and humoral immunity. Nociceptors can be activated by antigen-induced accumulation of splenic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and then release calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which further promotes the splenic GC response at the early stage. Mechanistically, CGRP directly acts on B cells through its receptor CALCRL-RAMP1 via the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. Activating nociceptors by ingesting capsaicin enhances the splenic GC response and anti-influenza immunity. Collectively, our study establishes a specific DRG-spleen sensory neural connection that promotes humoral immunity, suggesting a promising approach for improving host defense by targeting the nociceptive nervous system.

Rapid coordination between events outside and inside the cell is essential. Single-molecule fluorescence dynamics show that ligand binding to the bent-closed integrin conformation, which predominates on cell surfaces, is followed within milliseconds by two concerted changes, leg extension and headpiece opening, to give the high-affinity integrin conformation. The extended-closed integrin conformation is not an intermediate but can be directly accessed from the extended-open conformation and provides a pathway for ligand dissociation. In contrast to ligand, talin, which links the integrin \u03b2-subunit cytoplasmic domain to the actin cytoskeleton, modestly stabilizes but does not induce extension or opening. Integrin activation is thus initiated by outside-in signaling and followed by inside-out signaling. Our results further imply that talin binding is insufficient for inside-out integrin activation and that tensile force transmission through the ligand-integrin-talin-actin cytoskeleton complex is required.

In people living with HIV-1, bnAbs take years to develop. The HVTN 133 clinical trial studied a peptide/liposome immunogen targeting B cell lineages of HIV-1 envelope (Env) membrane-proximal external region (MPER) bnAbs (NCT03934541). Here, we report MPER peptide-liposome induction of polyclonal HIV-1 B cell lineages of mature bnAbs and their precursors, the most potent of which neutralized 15% of global tier 2 HIV-1 strains and 35% of clade B strains with lineage initiation after the second immunization. Neutralization was enhanced by vaccine selection of improbable mutations that increased antibody binding to gp41 and lipids. This study demonstrates proof of concept for rapid vaccine induction of human B cell lineages with heterologous neutralizing activity and selection of antibody improbable mutations and outlines a path for successful HIV-1 vaccine development."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Rebecca A Green", "authorLink": "/?term=Green+RA&cauthor_id=38759650", "affiliationTitle": "Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

To tackle this challenge, we used 4D imaging of C. elegans embryogenesis to capture the effects of 500 gene knockdowns and developed an automated approach to compare developmental phenotypes. The automated approach quantifies features-including germ layer cell numbers, tissue position, and tissue shape-to generate temporal curves whose parameterization yields numerical phenotypic signatures. In conjunction with a new similarity metric that operates across phenotypic space, these signatures enabled the generation of ranked lists of genes predicted to have similar functions, accessible in the PhenoBank web portal, for \u223c25% of essential development genes. The approach identified new gene and pathway relationships in cell fate specification and morphogenesis and highlighted the utilization of specialized energy generation pathways during embryogenesis. Collectively, the effort establishes the foundation for comprehensive analysis of the gene set that builds a multicellular organism.

We show that ARID1A loss in murine models is sufficient to induce anti-tumor immune phenotypes observed in ARID1A mutant human cancers, including increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and cytolytic activity. ARID1A-deficient cancers upregulated an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature, the ARID1A-IFN signature, associated with increased R-loops and cytosolic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Overexpression of the R-loop resolving enzyme, RNASEH2B, or cytosolic DNase, TREX1, in ARID1A-deficient cells prevented cytosolic ssDNA accumulation and ARID1A-IFN gene upregulation. Further, the ARID1A-IFN signature and anti-tumor immunity were driven by STING-dependent type I IFN signaling, which was required for improved responsiveness of ARID1A mutant tumors to ICB treatment.

Here, we reveal a direct differentiation pathway from hematopoietic stem cells into platelets that is progressively propagated upon aging. Remarkably, the aging-enriched platelet path is decoupled from all other hematopoietic lineages, including erythropoiesis, and operates as an additional layer in parallel with canonical platelet production. This results in two molecularly and functionally distinct populations of megakaryocyte progenitors. The age-induced megakaryocyte progenitors have a profoundly enhanced capacity to engraft, expand, restore, and reconstitute platelets in situ and upon transplantation and produce an additional platelet population in old mice. The two pools of co-existing platelets cause age-related thrombocytosis and dramatically increased thrombosis in vivo. Strikingly, aging-enriched platelets are functionally hyper-reactive compared with the canonical platelet populations.

Here, we performed prospective lineage tracing of human embryos using live imaging, non-invasive cell labeling, and computational predictions to determine the contribution of each 2-cell stage blastomere to the epiblast (body), hypoblast (yolk sac), and trophectoderm (placenta). We show that the majority of epiblast cells originate from only one blastomere of the 2-cell stage embryo. We observe that only one to three cells become internalized at the 8-to-16-cell stage transition. Moreover, these internalized cells are more frequently derived from the first cell to divide at the 2-cell stage. We propose that cell division dynamics and a cell internalization bottleneck in the early embryo establish asymmetry in the clonal composition of the future human body.

Whether the biomechanical property of ECM impacts the functionality of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the transcription factor (TF) Osr2 integrates biomechanical signaling and facilitates the terminal exhaustion of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells. Osr2 expression is selectively induced in the terminally exhausted tumor-specific CD8+ T cell subset by coupled T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and biomechanical stress mediated by the Piezo1/calcium/CREB axis. Consistently, depletion of Osr2 alleviates the exhaustion of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells or CAR-T cells, whereas forced Osr2 expression aggravates their exhaustion in solid tumor models. Mechanistically, Osr2 recruits HDAC3 to rewire the epigenetic program for suppressing cytotoxic gene expression and promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Thus, our results unravel Osr2 functions as a biomechanical checkpoint to exacerbate CD8+ T cell exhaustion and could be targeted to potentiate cancer immunotherapy.

How vertebrate centromeres obtain a three-dimensional structure to accomplish their primary function is unclear. Using super-resolution imaging, capture-C, and polymer modeling, we show that vertebrate centromeres are partitioned by condensins into two subdomains during mitosis. The bipartite structure is found in human, mouse, and chicken cells and is therefore a fundamental feature of vertebrate centromeres. Super-resolution imaging and electron tomography reveal that bipartite centromeres assemble bipartite kinetochores, with each subdomain binding a distinct microtubule bundle. Cohesin links the centromere subdomains, limiting their separation in response to spindle forces and avoiding merotelic kinetochore-spindle attachments. Lagging chromosomes during cancer cell divisions frequently have merotelic attachments in which the centromere subdomains are separated and bioriented. Our work reveals a fundamental aspect of vertebrate centromere biology with implications for understanding the mechanisms that guarantee faithful chromosome segregation.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By opto-stimulating different populations of descending spinal projecting neurons (SPNs) in anesthetized mice, we show that stimulation of excitatory SPNs in the rostral ventromedial medulla (rVMM) resulted in a simultaneous increase in somatomotor and sympathetic activities. Conversely, opto-stimulation of rVMM inhibitory SPNs decreased both activities. Anatomically, these SPNs innervate both sympathetic preganglionic neurons and motor-related regions in the spinal cord. Fiber-photometry recording indicated that the activities of rVMM SPNs correlate with different levels of muscle and sympathetic tone during distinct arousal states. Inhibiting rVMM excitatory SPNs reduced basal muscle and sympathetic tone, impairing locomotion initiation and high-speed performance. In contrast, silencing the inhibitory population abolished muscle atonia and sympathetic hypoactivity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Together, these results identify rVMM SPNs as descending spinal projecting pathways controlling the tone of both the somatomotor and sympathetic systems.

Combining viral labeling, genetic marking, and single-cell profiling in the mouse retina, we discovered a perivascular neuronal subset, annotated as Fam19a4/Nts-positive retinal ganglion cells (Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs), directly contacting the vasculature with perisomatic endfeet. Developmental ablation of Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs led to disoriented growth of penetrating vessels near the ganglion cell layer (GCL), leading to a disorganized 3D vascular lattice. We identified enriched PIEZO2 expression in Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs. Piezo2 loss from all retinal neurons or Fam19a4/Nts-RGCs abolished the direct neurovascular contacts and phenocopied the Fam19a4/Nts-RGC ablation deficits. The defective vascular structure led to reduced capillary perfusion and sensitized the retina to ischemic insults.

However, we do not know the synaptic sign for each connection (i.e., whether a connection is excitatory or inhibitory), which is implied by the released transmitter. We demonstrate that artificial neural networks can predict transmitter types for presynapses from electron micrographs: a network trained to predict six transmitters (acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, octopamine) achieves an accuracy of 87% for individual synapses, 94% for neurons, and 91% for known cell types across a D. melanogaster whole brain. We visualize the ultrastructural features used for prediction, discovering subtle but significant differences between transmitter phenotypes.

Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins following germination on a hydrophobic surface, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during appressorium development. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify phosphoproteins regulated by the fungal Pmk1 MAPK that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 32 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of regulator Vts1 is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for the control of plant diseases.

To holistically characterize histomorphology, 3D imaging modalities have been developed, but clinical translation is hampered by complex manual evaluation and lack of computational platforms to distill clinical insights from large, high-resolution datasets. We present TriPath, a deep-learning platform for processing tissue volumes and efficiently predicting clinical outcomes based on 3D morphological features. Recurrence risk-stratification models were trained on prostate cancer specimens imaged with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography. By comprehensively capturing 3D morphologies, 3D volume-based prognostication achieves superior performance to traditional 2D slice-based approaches, including clinical/histopathological baselines from six certified genitourinary pathologists. Incorporating greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk prediction variability from sampling bias, further emphasizing the value of capturing larger extents of heterogeneous morphology.

This study combines an RNA-based HBV cell culture system with deep mutational scanning (DMS) to uncouple cis- and trans-acting sequence requirements in the HBV genome. The results support a leaky ribosome scanning model for polymerase translation, provide a fitness map of the HBV polymerase at single-nucleotide resolution, and identify conserved prolines adjacent to the HBV polymerase termination codon that stall ribosomes. Further experiments indicated that stalled ribosomes tether the nascent polymerase to its template RNA, ensuring cis-preferential RNA packaging and reverse transcription of the HBV genome.

Here, we show in murine and human cancers that these parameters exhibit circadian oscillations, driven by both the endogenous circadian clock of leukocytes and rhythmic leukocyte infiltration, which depends on the circadian clock of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. To harness these rhythms therapeutically, we demonstrate that efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade can be improved by adjusting the time of treatment during the day. Furthermore, time-of-day-dependent T cell signatures in murine tumor models predict overall survival in patients with melanoma and correlate with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our data demonstrate the functional significance of circadian dynamics in the tumor microenvironment and suggest the importance of leveraging these features for improving future clinical trial design and patient care.

However, heterogeneity and spatial organization of these cells in human bone marrow remain largely uncharacterized. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile 29,325 non-hematopoietic cells and discovered nine transcriptionally distinct subtypes. We simultaneously profiled 53,417 hematopoietic cells and predicted their interactions with non-hematopoietic subsets. We employed co-detection by indexing (CODEX) to spatially profile over 1.2 million cells. We integrated scRNA-seq and CODEX data to link predicted cellular signaling with spatial proximity. Our analysis revealed a hyperoxygenated arterio-endosteal neighborhood for early myelopoiesis, and an adipocytic localization for early hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We used our CODEX atlas to annotate new images and uncovered mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) expansion and spatial neighborhoods co-enriched for leukemic blasts and MSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. This spatially resolved, multiomic atlas of human bone marrow provides a reference for investigation of cellular interactions that drive hematopoiesis.

We describe three humans homozygous for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections, including severe cutaneous warts. The patients#QUOTE# bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic, with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors. Counts of B cells, monocytes, and DCs were low in the patients#QUOTE# blood, whereas the other blood subsets, including NK cells, were affected only moderately, if at all. The patients had normal counts of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal macrophages in the skin but lacked dermal DCs. Thus, FLT3L is required for B cell and DC development in mice and humans. However, unlike its murine counterpart, human FLT3L is required for the development of monocytes but not NK cells.

We found that oligodendrocytes in the lesions are epigenetically silenced. Developing a transgenic reporter labeling differentiated oligodendrocytes for phenotypic screening, we identified a small-molecule epigenetic-silencing-inhibitor (ESI1) that enhances myelin production and ensheathment. ESI1 promotes remyelination in animal models of demyelination and enables de novo myelinogenesis on regenerated CNS axons. ESI1 treatment lengthened myelin sheaths in human iPSC-derived organoids and augmented (re)myelination in aged mice while reversing age-related cognitive decline. Multi-omics revealed that ESI1 induces an active chromatin landscape that activates myelinogenic pathways and reprograms metabolism. Notably, ESI1 triggered nuclear condensate formation of master lipid-metabolic regulators SREBP1/2, concentrating transcriptional co-activators to drive lipid/cholesterol biosynthesis. Our study highlights the potential of targeting epigenetic silencing to enable CNS myelin regeneration in demyelinating diseases and aging.

Here, we create #QUOTE#onion-like#QUOTE# multi-lamellar RNA lipid particle aggregates (LPAs) to substantially enhance the payload packaging and immunogenicity of tumor mRNA antigens. Unlike current mRNA vaccine designs that rely on payload packaging into nanoparticle cores for Toll-like receptor engagement in immune cells, systemically administered RNA-LPAs activate RIG-I in stromal cells, eliciting massive cytokine/chemokine response and dendritic cell/lymphocyte trafficking that provokes cancer immunogenicity and mediates rejection of both early- and late-stage murine tumor models. In client-owned canines with terminal gliomas, RNA-LPAs improved survivorship and reprogrammed the TME, which became #QUOTE#hot#QUOTE# within days of a single infusion. In a first-in-human trial, RNA-LPAs elicited rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, and glioma-specific immune responses in glioblastoma patients. These data support RNA-LPAs as a new technology that simultaneously reprograms the TME while eliciting rapid and enduring cancer immunotherapy.

Many inflammatory signals, such as circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), activate NF-\u03baB via specific receptors. Using whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screens of LPS-treated cells that express an NF-\u03baB-driven suicide gene, we discovered that the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is specifically dependent on the oligosaccharyltransferase complex OST-A for N-glycosylation and cell-surface localization. The tool compound NGI-1 inhibits OST complexes in vivo, but the underlying molecular mechanism remained unknown. We did a CRISPR base-editor screen for NGI-1-resistant variants of STT3A, the catalytic subunit of OST-A. These variants, in conjunction with cryoelectron microscopy studies, revealed that NGI-1 binds the catalytic site of STT3A, where it traps a molecule of the donor substrate dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc2-Man9-Glc3, suggesting an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism.

Here, we apply blastocyst complementation to selectively build and test interspecies neural circuits. Despite approximately 10-20 million years of evolution, and prominent species differences in brain size, rat pluripotent stem cells injected into mouse blastocysts develop and persist throughout the mouse brain. Unexpectedly, the mouse niche reprograms the birth dates of rat neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, supporting rat-mouse synaptic activity. When mouse olfactory neurons are genetically silenced or killed, rat neurons restore information flow to odor processing circuits. Moreover, they rescue the primal behavior of food seeking, although less well than mouse neurons. By revealing that a mouse can sense the world using neurons from another species, we establish neural blastocyst complementation as a powerful tool to identify conserved mechanisms of brain development, plasticity, and repair.

Here, we developed an optimized IBC strategy based on C-CRISPR, which facilitated rapid screening of candidate genes and identified that Hesx1 deficiency supported the generation of rat forebrain tissue in mice via IBC. Xenogeneic rat forebrain tissues in adult mice were structurally and functionally intact. Cross-species comparative analyses revealed that rat forebrain tissues developed at the same pace as the mouse host but maintained rat-like transcriptome profiles. The chimeric rate of rat cells gradually decreased as development progressed, suggesting xenogeneic barriers during mid-to-late pre-natal development.

Subsequent breeding for disease resistance underpins modern agriculture and, along with the emergence and focus on model plants for genetics and genomics research, has provided rich resources for molecular biological exploration over the last 50 years. These studies led to the identification of extracellular and intracellular receptors that convert recognition of extracellular microbe-encoded molecular patterns or intracellular pathogen-delivered virulence effectors into defense activation.

We discuss the intracellular and intercellular processes shaping antigen specificity and recognition in immune activation and lymphocyte functions in mediating effector and memory responses. We also describe how lymphocytes balance protective immunity against autoimmunity and immunopathology, including during immune tolerance, response to chronic antigen stimulation, and adaptation to non-lymphoid tissues in coordinating tissue immunity and homeostasis. Finally, we discuss extracellular signals and cell-intrinsic programs underpinning adaptive immunity and conclude by summarizing key advances in vaccination and engineering adaptive immune responses for therapeutic interventions.

Peptic ulcer disease is usually attributable to Helicobacter pylori infection, intake of some medications (such as aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), or being critically ill (stress-related), or it can be idiopathic. The clinical presentation is usually uncomplicated, with peptic ulcer disease management based on eradicating H pylori if present, the use of acid-suppressing medications-most often proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-or addressing complications, such as with early endoscopy and high-dose PPIs for peptic ulcer bleeding. Special considerations apply to patients on antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. H pylori treatment has evolved, with the choice of regimen dictated by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Indications for primary and secondary prophylaxis vary across societies; most suggest PPIs for patients at highest risk of developing a peptic ulcer, its complications, or its recurrence. Additional research areas include the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers and H pylori vaccination; the optimal approach for patients at risk of stress ulcer bleeding requires more robust determinations of optimal patient selection and treatment selection, if any.

The current standard of haemoglobin monitoring is insufficient to ensure the maintenance of proper iron reserves and donor health. We aimed to determine the effects of ferritin-guided donation intervals for blood donor health and blood supply in the Netherlands.              Methods:                    In this stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial (FIND#QUOTE#EM), the 138 fixed and mobile donation centres in the Netherlands are organised into 29 geographical clusters and the clusters were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, with two groups being further split into two per a protocol amendment. Eligible donors were whole-blood donors who consented for use of their leftover material in the study. Each group was sequentially crossed over from the existing policy (haemoglobin-based screening; control) to a ferritin-guided donation interval policy over a 3-year period. In the intervention groups, in addition to the existing haemoglobin screening, ferritin was measured in all new donors and at every fifth donation in repeat donors. Subsequent donation intervals were extended to 6 months if ferritin concentrations were 15-30 ng/mL and to 12 months if they were less than 15 ng/mL. Outcomes were measured cross-sectionally across all donation centres at four timepoints. Primary outcomes were ferritin and haemoglobin concentrations, iron deficiency, and haemoglobin-based deferrals. We assessed all outcomes by sex and menopausal status and significance for primary outcomes was indicated by a p value of less than 0\u00b70125. This trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, NTR6738, and is complete.              Findings:                    Between Sept 11, 2017, and Nov 27, 2020, 412 888 whole-blood donors visited a donation centre, and we did measurements on samples from 37 621 donations from 36 099 donors. Over 38 months, ferritin-guided donation intervals increased mean ferritin concentrations (by 0\u00b718 log10 ng/mL [95% CI 0\u00b715-0\u00b722; p<0\u00b70001] in male donors, 0\u00b710 log10 ng/mL [0\u00b706-0\u00b715; p<0\u00b70001] in premenopausal female donors, and 0\u00b717 log10 ng/mL [0\u00b712-0\u00b721; p<0\u00b70001] in postmenopausal female donors) and mean haemoglobin concentrations (by 0\u00b730 g/dL [95% CI 0\u00b722-0\u00b738; p<0\u00b70001] in male donors, 0\u00b712 g/dL [0\u00b703-0\u00b720; p<0\u00b70074] in premenopausal female donors, and 0\u00b716 g/dL [0\u00b705-0\u00b727; p<0\u00b70044] in postmenopausal female donors). Iron deficiency decreased by 36-38 months (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b724 [95% CI 0\u00b718-0\u00b731; p<0\u00b70001] for male donors, 0\u00b749 [0\u00b737-0\u00b764; p<0\u00b70001] for premenopausal female donors, and 0\u00b724 [0\u00b715-0\u00b737; p<0\u00b70001] for postmenopausal female donors). At 36-38 months, haemoglobin-based deferral decreased significantly in male donors (OR at 36-38 months 0\u00b721 [95% CI 0\u00b710-0\u00b740, p<0\u00b70001]) but not significantly in premenopausal or postmenopausal female donors (0\u00b781 [0\u00b754-1\u00b720; p=0\u00b729] and 0\u00b750 [95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b798; p=0\u00b7051], respectively).              Interpretation:                    Ferritin-guided donation intervals significantly improved haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and significantly decreased iron deficiency over the study period. Haemoglobin-based deferrals decreased significantly for male donors, but not female donors. Although this intervention is overall beneficial for maintenance of iron and haemoglobin concentrations in donors, increased efforts are needed to recruit and retain donors.

These symptoms are associated with substantial disability and represent a major burden for patients, health-care professionals, and society. Persistent physical symptoms can follow infections, injuries, medical diseases, stressful life events, or arise de novo. As symptoms persist, their link to clearly identifiable pathophysiology often weakens, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Multiple biological and psychosocial risk factors and mechanisms contribute to the persistence of somatic symptoms, including persistent inflammation; epigenetic profiles; immune, metabolic and microbiome dysregulation; early adverse life experiences; depression; illness-related anxiety; dysfunctional symptom expectations; symptom focusing; symptom learning; and avoidance behaviours, with many factors being common across symptoms and diagnoses. Basic care consists of addressing underlying pathophysiology and using person-centred communication techniques with validation, appropriate reassurance, and biopsychosocial explanation. If basic care is insufficient, targeted psychological and pharmacological interventions can be beneficial. A better understanding of the multifactorial persistence of somatic symptoms should lead to more specific, personalised, and mechanism-based treatment, and a reduction in the stigma patients commonly face."}, {"authorship": [{"authorName": "Shin-Ichiro Hayashi", "authorLink": "/?term=Hayashi+SI&cauthor_id=38879262", "affiliationTitle": "Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Osaka, Japan; Division of Hypertension and Nephrology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Osaka, Japan; Department of Clinical Gene Therapy, University of Osaka Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based symptom-clinic intervention in people with multiple and persistent physical symptoms, hypothesising that this symptoms clinic plus usual care would be superior to usual care only.              Methods:                    The Multiple Symptoms Study 3 was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, individually randomised controlled trial conducted in 108 general practices in the UK National Health Service in four regions of England between Dec 6, 2018, and June 30, 2023. Participants were individually randomised (1:1) to the symptom-clinic intervention plus usual care or to usual care only via a computer-generated, pseudo-random list stratified by trial centre. Allocation was done by the trial statistician and concealed with a centralised, web-based randomisation system; masking participants was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. The symptom-clinic intervention was a sequence of up to four medical consultations that aimed to elicit a detailed clinical history, fully hear and validate the participant, offer rational explanations for symptoms, and assist the participant to develop ways of managing their symptoms; it was delivered by general practitioners with an extended role. The primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) score 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed by intention to treat. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN57050216).              Findings:                    354 participants were randomly assigned; 178 (50%) were assigned to receive the community-based symptoms clinic plus usual care and 176 (50%) were assigned to receive usual care only. At the primary-outcome point of 52 weeks, PHQ-15 scores were 14\u00b71 (SD 3\u00b77) in the group receiving usual care and 12\u00b72 (4\u00b75) in the group receiving the intervention. The adjusted between-group difference of -1\u00b782 (95% CI -2\u00b767 to -0\u00b797) was statistically significantly in favour of the intervention group (p<0\u00b70001). There were 39 adverse events in the group receiving usual care and 36 adverse events in the group receiving the intervention. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the proportion of participants who had non-serious adverse events (-0\u00b703, 95% CI -0\u00b711 to 0\u00b705) or serious adverse events (0\u00b702, -0\u00b702 to 0\u00b707). No serious adverse event was deemed to be related to the trial intervention.              Interpretation:                    Our symptom-clinic intervention, which focused on explaining persistent symptoms to participants in order to support self-management, led to sustained improvement in multiple and persistent physical symptoms.

[], "abstract": "Abstract                        Background:                    Neoadjuvant therapy is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the prognosis remains poor and more intensive neoadjuvant treatment might be needed to improve patient outcomes. We therefore aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant doublet chemotherapy, triplet chemotherapy, and doublet chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced OSCC.              Methods:                    In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, patients aged 20-75 years with previously untreated locally advanced OSCC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were recruited from 44 centres across Japan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) centrally via a web-based system to receive neoadjuvant doublet chemotherapy (two courses of fluorouracil [800 mg/m2 per day intravenously on days 1-5] and cisplatin [80 mg/m2 per day on day 1] separated by an interval of 3 weeks [NeoCF]), triplet chemotherapy (three courses of fluorouracil [750 mg/m2 per day on days 1-5], cisplatin [70 mg/m2 per day on day 1], and docetaxel [70 mg/m2 per day on day 1] repeated every 3 weeks [NeoCF+D]), or doublet chemotherapy (two courses of fluorouracil [1000 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4] and cisplatin [75 mg/m2 per day on day 1] separated by an interval of 4 weeks) plus 41\u00b74 Gy radiotherapy [NeoCF+RT]) followed by oesophagectomy with regional lymph node dissection. Randomisation was stratified by T stage and institution. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were not masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. Analysis of safety included all patients who received at least one course of chemotherapy, and analysis of surgical complications included those who also underwent surgery. This study is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs031180202, and the trial is complete.              Findings:                    A total of 601 patients (529 male individuals and 72 female individuals) were randomly assigned between Dec 5, 2012, and July 20, 2018, with 199 patients in the NeoCF group, 202 patients in the NeoCF+D group, and 200 patients in the NeoCF+RT group. Compared with the NeoCF group, during a median follow-up period of 50\u00b77 months (IQR 23\u00b78-70\u00b77), the 3-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in the NeoCF+D group (72\u00b71% [95% CI 65\u00b74-77\u00b78] vs 62\u00b76% [55\u00b75-68\u00b79]; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b750-0\u00b792; p=0\u00b7006) but not in the NeoCF+RT group (68\u00b73% [61\u00b73-74\u00b73]; HR 0\u00b784, 0\u00b763-1\u00b712; p=0\u00b712). Grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia occurred in two (1%) of 193 patients in the NeoCF group, 32 (16%) of 196 patients in the NeoCF+D group, and nine (5%) of 191 patients in the NeoCF+RT group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to termination of neoadjuvant therapy were more common in the NeoCF+D group (18 [9%] of 202 participants) than in the NeoCF+RT group (12 [6%] of 200) and NeoCF group (eight [4%] of 199). There were three (2%) treatment-related deaths during neoadjuvant therapy in the NeoCF group, four (2%) deaths in the NeoCF+D group, and two (1%) deaths in the NeoCF+RT group. Grade 2 or higher postoperative pneumonia, anastomotic leak, and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis were reported in 19 (10%), 19 (10%), and 28 (15%) of 185 patients, respectively, in the NeoCF group; 18 (10%), 16 (9%), and 19 (10%) of 183 patients, respectively, in the NeoCF+D group; and 23 (13%), 23 (13%), and 17 (10%) of 178 patients, respectively, in the NeoCF+RT group. The in-hospital deaths following surgery included three deaths in the NeoCF group, two deaths in the NeoCF+D group, and one in the NeoCF+RT group.              Interpretation:                    Neoadjuvant triplet chemotherapy followed by oesophagectomy resulted in a statistically significant overall survival benefit compared with doublet chemotherapy and might be the new standard of care for locally advanced OSCC who are in good condition in Japan. Neoadjuvant doublet chemotherapy plus radiotherapy did not show significant improvement of survival compared with doublet chemotherapy.

The first-line therapy is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents delivered by intravitreal injection. Ionising radiation mitigates key pathogenic processes underlying nAMD, and therefore has therapeutic potential. STAR aimed to assess whether stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) reduces the number of anti-VEGF injections required, without sacrificing visual acuity.              Methods:                    This pivotal, randomised, double-masked, sham-controlled trial enrolled participants with pretreated chronic active nAMD from 30 UK hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to 16-Gray (Gy) SRT delivered using a robotically controlled device or sham SRT, stratified by treatment centre. Eligible participants were aged 50 years or older and had chronic active nAMD, with at least three previous anti-VEGF injections, including at least one in the last 4 months. Participants and all trial and image reading centre staff were masked to treatment allocation, except one unmasked statistician. The primary outcome was the number of intravitreal ranibizumab injections required over 2 years, tested for superiority (fewer injections). The main secondary outcome was Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity at two years, tested for non-inferiority (five-letter margin). The primary analysis used the intention-to-treat principle, and safety was analysed per-protocol on participants with available data. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02243878) and is closed for recruitment.              Findings:                    411 participants enrolled between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 27, 2019, and 274 were randomly allocated to the 16-Gy SRT group and 137 to the sham SRT group. 240 (58%) of all participants were female, and 171 (42%) of all participants were male. 241 participants in the 16-Gy SRT group and 118 participants in the sham group were included in the final analysis, and 409 patients were treated and formed the safety population, of whom two patients allocated to sham treatment erroneously received 16-Gy SRT. The SRT group received a mean of 10\u00b77 injections (SD 6\u00b73) over 2 years versus 13\u00b73 injections (5\u00b78) with sham, a reduction of 2\u00b79 injections after adjusting for treatment centre (95% CI -4\u00b72 to -1\u00b76, p<0\u00b70001). The SRT group best-corrected visual acuity change was non-inferior to sham (adjusted mean letter loss difference between groups, -1\u00b77 letters [95% CI -4\u00b72 to 0\u00b78]). Adverse event rates were similar across groups, but reading centre-detected microvascular abnormalities occurred in 77 SRT-treated eyes (35%) and 13 (12%) sham-treated eyes. Overall, eyes with microvascular abnormalities tended to have better best-corrected visual acuity than those without. Fewer ranibizumab injections offset the cost of SRT, saving a mean of \u00a3565 per participant (95% CI -332 to 1483).              Interpretation:                    SRT can reduce ranibizumab treatment burden without compromising vision.

Unlike coronary disease, which is typically caused by atherosclerosis, ischaemic stroke is caused by diverse mechanisms including atherosclerosis and small vessel disease or is frequently due to an unknown cause. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that long-term colchicine would reduce recurrent events after ischaemic stroke.              Methods:                    We did a randomised, parallel-group, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed trial comparing long-term colchicine (0\u00b75 mg orally per day) plus guideline-based usual care with usual care only. Hospital-based patients with non-severe, non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or high-risk transient ischaemic attack were eligible. The primary endpoint was a composite of first fatal or non-fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or hospitalisation (defined as an admission to an inpatient unit or a visit to an emergency department that resulted in at least a 24 h stay [or a change in calendar date if the hospital admission or discharge times were not available]) for unstable angina. The p value for significance was 0\u00b7048 to adjust for two prespecified interim analyses conducted by the data monitoring committee, for which the steering committee and trial investigators remained blinded. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02898610) and is completed.              Findings:                    3154 patients were randomly assigned between Dec 19, 2016, and Nov 21, 2022, with the last follow-up on Jan 31, 2024. The trial finished before the anticipated number of outcomes was accrued (367 outcomes planned) due to budget constraints attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten patients withdrew consent for analysis of their data, leaving 3144 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis: 1569 (colchicine and usual care) and 1575 (usual care alone). A primary endpoint occurred in 338 patients, 153 (9\u00b78%) of 1569 patients allocated to colchicine and usual care and 185 (11\u00b77%) of 1575 patients allocated to usual care alone (incidence rates 3\u00b732 vs 3\u00b792 per 100 person-years, hazard ratio 0\u00b784; 95% CI 0\u00b768-1\u00b705, p=0\u00b712). Although no between-group difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) was observed at baseline, patients treated with colchicine had lower CRP at 28 days and at 1, 2, and 3 years (p<0\u00b705 for all timepoints). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in both groups.              Interpretation:                    Although no statistically significant benefit was observed on the primary intention-to-treat analysis, the findings provide new evidence supporting the rationale for anti-inflammatory therapy in further randomised trials.

Burr-hole drainage surgery, to evacuate chronic subdural haematoma, involves three elements: creation of a burr hole for access, irrigation of the subdural space, and insertion of a subdural drain. Although the subdural drain has been established as beneficial, the therapeutic effect of subdural irrigation has not been addressed.              Methods:                    The FINISH trial was an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, multicentre, nationwide, randomised, controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial in five neurosurgical units in Finland that enrolled adults aged 18 years or older with a chronic subdural haematoma requiring burr-hole drainage. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation with block sizes of four, six, or eight, stratified by site, to burr-hole drainage either with or without subdural irrigation. All patients and staff were masked to treatment assignment apart from the neurosurgeon and operating room staff. A burr hole was drilled at the site of maximum haematoma thickness in both groups, and the subdural space was either irrigated or not irrigated before inserting a subdural drain, which remained in place for 48 h. Reoperations, functional outcome, mortality, and adverse events were recorded for 6 months after surgery. The primary outcome was the reoperation rate within 6 months. The non-inferiority margin was set at 7\u00b75%. Key secondary outcomes that were also required to conclude non-inferiority were the proportion of participants with unfavourable functional outcomes (ie, modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 6 indicates death) and mortality rate at 6 months. The primary and key secondary analyses were done in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04203550) and is completed.              Findings:                    From Jan 1, 2020, to Aug 17, 2022, we assessed 1644 patients for eligibility and 589 (36%) patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and treated (294 assigned to drainage with irrigation and 295 assigned to drainage without irrigation; 165 [28%] women and 424 [72%] men). The 6-month follow-up period extended until Feb 14, 2023. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 54 (18\u00b73%) of 295 participants required reoperation in the group assigned to receive no irrigation versus 37 (12\u00b76%) of 294 in the group assigned to receive irrigation (difference of 6\u00b70 percentage points, 95% CI 0\u00b72-11\u00b77; p=0\u00b730; adjusted for study site). There were no significant between-group differences in the proportion of people with modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6 (37 [13\u00b71%] of 283 in the no-irrigation group vs 36 [12\u00b76%] of 285 in the irrigation group; p=0\u00b789) or mortality rate (18 [6\u00b71%] of 295 in the no-irrigation group vs 21 [7\u00b71%] of 294 in the irrigation group; p=0\u00b758). The findings of the primary intention-to-treat analysis were not materially altered in the per-protocol analysis. There were no significant between-group differences in the number of adverse events, and the most frequent severe adverse events were systemic infections (26 [8\u00b78%] of 295 participants who did not receive irrigation vs 22 [7\u00b75%] of 294 participants who received irrigation), intracranial haemorrhage (13 [4\u00b74%] vs seven [2\u00b74%]), and epileptic seizures (five [1\u00b77%] vs nine [3\u00b71%]).              Interpretation:                    We could not conclude non-inferiority of burr-hole drainage without irrigation. The reoperation rate was 6\u00b70 percentage points higher after burr-hole drainage without subdural irrigation than with subdural irrigation.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (177Lu-Dotatate) treatment.              Methods:                    NETTER-2 was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients (aged \u226515 years) with newly diagnosed higher grade 2 (Ki67 \u226510% and \u226420%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and \u226455%), somatostatin receptor-positive (in all target lesions), advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from 45 centres across nine countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used interactive response technologies to randomly assign (2:1) patients to receive four cycles (cycle interval was 8 weeks \u00b1 1 week) of intravenous 177Lu-Dotatate plus intramuscular octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) then octreotide 30 mg LAR every 4 weeks (177Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks (control group), stratified by neuroendocrine tumour grade (2 vs 3) and origin (pancreas vs other). Tumour assessments were done at baseline, week 16, and week 24, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded, independent, central radiology assessment. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival events as the final progression-free survival analysis. NETTER-2 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488, and is active and not recruiting.              Findings:                    Between Jan 22, 2020, and Oct 13, 2022, we screened 261 patients, 35 (13%) of whom were excluded. We randomly assigned 226 (87%) patients (121 [54%] male and 105 [46%] female) to the 177Lu-Dotatate group (n=151 [67%]) and control group (n=75 [33%]). Median progression-free survival was 8\u00b75 months (95% CI 7\u00b77-13\u00b78) in the control group and 22\u00b78 months (19\u00b74-not estimated) in the 177Lu-Dotatate group (stratified hazard ratio 0\u00b7276 [0\u00b7182-0\u00b7418]; p<0\u00b70001). During the treatment period, adverse events (of any grade) occurred in 136 (93%) of 147 treated patients in the 177Lu-Dotatate group and 69 (95%) of 73 treated patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related deaths during the treatment period.              Interpretation:                    First-line 177Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR significantly extended median progression-free survival (by 14 months) in patients with grade 2 or 3 advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. 177Lu-Dotatate should be considered a new standard of care in first-line therapy in this population.

Walking 2 weeks after surgery (early weight-bearing) might be a safe and preferable rehabilitation strategy. This study aimed to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of an early weight-bearing strategy compared with a delayed weight-bearing strategy.              Methods:                    This was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial including 561 participants (aged \u226518 years) who received acute surgery for an unstable ankle fracture in 23 UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals who were assigned to either a delayed weight-bearing (n=280) or an early weight-bearing rehabilitation strategy (n=281). Patients treated with a hindfoot nail, those who did not have protective ankle sensation (eg, peripheral neuropathy), did not have the capacity to consent, or did not have the ability to adhere to trial procedures were excluded. Neither participants nor clinicians were masked to the treatment. The primary outcome was ankle function measured using the Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) at 4 months after randomisation, in the per-protocol population. The pre-specified non-inferiority OMAS margin was -6 points and superiority testing was included in the intention-to-treat population in the event of non-inferiority. The trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN12883981, and the trial is closed to new participants.              Findings:                    Primary outcome data were collected from 480 (86%) of 561 participants. Recruitment was conducted between Jan 13, 2020, and Oct 29, 2021. At 4 months after randomisation, the mean OMAS score was 65\u00b79 in the early weight-bearing and 61\u00b72 in the delayed weight-bearing group and adjusted mean difference was 4\u00b747 (95% CI 0\u00b758 to 8\u00b737, p=0\u00b7024; superiority testing adjusted difference 4\u00b742, 95% CI 0\u00b753 to 8\u00b732, p=0\u00b7026) in favour of early weight-bearing. 46 (16%) participants in the early weight-bearing group and 39 (14%) in the delayed weight-bearing group had one or more complications (adjusted odds ratio 1\u00b718, 95% CI 0\u00b780 to 1\u00b775, p=0\u00b740). The mean costs from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services in the early and delayed weight-bearing groups were \u00a3725 and \u00a3785, respectively (mean difference -\u00a360 [95% CI -342 to 232]). The probability that early weight-bearing is cost-effective exceeded 80%.              Interpretation:                    An early weight-bearing strategy was found to be clinically non-inferior and highly likely to be cost-effective compared with the current standard of care (delayed weight-bearing).

"secondaryDate": null, "grants": [], "abstract": "Abstract                        Background:                    Tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT) is a locally aggressive neoplasm for which few systemic treatment options exist. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vimseltinib, an oral, switch-control, CSF1R inhibitor, in patients with symptomatic TGCT not amenable to surgery.              Methods:                    MOTION is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial done in 35 specialised hospitals in 13 countries. Eligible patients were adults (aged \u226518 years) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of TGCT for which surgical resection could potentially worsen functional limitation or cause severe morbidity. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) with interactive response technology to vimseltinib (30 mg orally twice weekly) or placebo, administrated in 28-day cycles for 24 weeks. Patients and site personnel were masked to treatment assignment until week 25, unless progressive disease was confirmed earlier. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent radiological review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST) at week 25 in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received the study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05059262, and enrolment is complete.              Findings:                    Between Jan 21, 2022, and Feb 21, 2023, 123 patients were randomly assigned (83 to vimseltinib and 40 to placebo). 73 (59%) patients were female and 50 (41%) were male. Nine (11%) of 83 patients assigned to vimseltinib and five (13%) of 40 patients assigned to placebo discontinued treatment before week 25; one patient in the placebo group did not receive any study drug. Objective response rate per RECIST was 40% (33 of 83 patients) in the vimseltinib group vs 0% (none of 40) in the placebo group (difference 40% [95% CI 29-51]; p<0\u00b70001). Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were grade 1 or 2; the only grade 3 or 4 TEAE that occurred in more than 5% of patients receiving vimseltinib was increased blood creatine phosphokinase (eight [10%] of 83). One patient in the vimseltinib group had a treatment-related serious TEAE of subcutaneous abscess. No evidence of cholestatic hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury was noted.              Interpretation:                    Vimseltinib produced a significant objective response rate and clinically meaningful functional and symptomatic improvement in patients with TGCT, providing an effective treatment option for these patients.

We assessed the addition of sintilimab, a PD-1 inhibitor, to standard chemoradiotherapy in this patient population.              Methods:                    This multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at nine hospitals in China. Adults aged 18-65 years with newly diagnosed high-risk non-metastatic stage III-IVa locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (excluding T3-4N0 and T3N1) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using blocks of four to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent cisplatin radiotherapy (standard therapy group) or standard therapy with 200 mg sintilimab intravenously once every 3 weeks for 12 cycles (comprising three induction, three concurrent, and six adjuvant cycles to radiotherapy; sintilimab group). The primary endpoint was event-free survival from randomisation to disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) or death from any cause in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints included adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03700476) and is now completed; follow-up is ongoing.              Findings:                    Between Dec 21, 2018, and March 31, 2020, 425 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the sintilimab (n=210) or standard therapy groups (n=215). At median follow-up of 41\u00b79 months (IQR 38\u00b70-44\u00b78; 389 alive at primary data cutoff [Feb 28, 2023] and 366 [94%] had at least 36 months of follow-up), event-free survival was higher in the sintilimab group compared with the standard therapy group (36-month rates 86% [95% CI 81-90] vs 76% [70-81]; stratified hazard ratio 0\u00b759 [0\u00b738-0\u00b792]; p=0\u00b7019). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 155 (74%) in the sintilimab group versus 140 (65%) in the standard therapy group, with the most common being stomatitis (68 [33%] vs 64 [30%]), leukopenia (54 [26%] vs 48 [22%]), and neutropenia (50 [24%] vs 46 [21%]). Two (1%) patients died in the sintilimab group (both considered to be immune-related) and one (<1%) in the standard therapy group. Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 20 (10%) patients in the sintilimab group.              Interpretation:                    Addition of sintilimab to chemoradiotherapy improved event-free survival, albeit with higher but manageable adverse events. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether this regimen can be considered as the standard of care for patients with high-risk locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

However, the widespread adoption of CCTA has revealed a large group of individuals without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), with unclear prognosis and management. Measurement of coronary inflammation from CCTA using the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) Score could enable cardiovascular risk prediction and guide the management of individuals without obstructive CAD. The Oxford Risk Factors And Non-invasive imaging (ORFAN) study aimed to evaluate the risk profile and event rates among patients undergoing CCTA as part of routine clinical care in the UK National Health Service (NHS); to test the hypothesis that coronary arterial inflammation drives cardiac mortality or major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with or without CAD; and to externally validate the performance of the previously trained artificial intelligence (AI)-Risk prognostic algorithm and the related AI-Risk classification system in a UK population.              Methods:                    This multicentre, longitudinal cohort study included 40 091 consecutive patients undergoing clinically indicated CCTA in eight UK hospitals, who were followed up for MACE (ie, myocardial infarction, new onset heart failure, or cardiac death) for a median of 2\u00b77 years (IQR 1\u00b74-5\u00b73). The prognostic value of FAI Score in the presence and absence of obstructive CAD was evaluated in 3393 consecutive patients from the two hospitals with the longest follow-up (7\u00b77 years [6\u00b74-9\u00b71]). An AI-enhanced cardiac risk prediction algorithm, which integrates FAI Score, coronary plaque metrics, and clinical risk factors, was then evaluated in this population.              Findings:                    In the 2\u00b77 year median follow-up period, patients without obstructive CAD (32 533 [81\u00b71%] of 40 091) accounted for 2857 (66\u00b73%) of the 4307 total MACE and 1118 (63\u00b77%) of the 1754 total cardiac deaths in the whole of Cohort A. Increased FAI Score in all the three coronary arteries had an additive impact on the risk for cardiac mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 29\u00b78 [95% CI 13\u00b79-63\u00b79], p<0\u00b7001) or MACE (12\u00b76 [8\u00b75-18\u00b76], p<0\u00b7001) comparing three vessels with an FAI Score in the top versus bottom quartile for each artery. FAI Score in any coronary artery predicted cardiac mortality and MACE independently from cardiovascular risk factors and the presence or extent of CAD. The AI-Risk classification was positively associated with cardiac mortality (6\u00b775 [5\u00b717-8\u00b782], p<0\u00b7001, for very high risk vs low or medium risk) and MACE (4\u00b768 [3\u00b793-5\u00b757], p<0\u00b7001 for very high risk vs low or medium risk). Finally, the AI-Risk model was well calibrated against true events.              Interpretation:                    The FAI Score captures inflammatory risk beyond the current clinical risk stratification and CCTA interpretation, particularly among patients without obstructive CAD. The AI-Risk integrates this information in a prognostic algorithm, which could be used as an alternative to traditional risk factor-based risk calculators.

To determine facility-level factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. Methods. We obtained COVID-19 case counts at 88 ICE detention facilities from May 6, 2020, through June 21, 2021, from the COVID Prison Project. We obtained information about facility population size, facility type (dedicated to immigrants or mixed with other incarcerated populations), and facility operator (public vs private contractor) from third-party sources. We defined the threshold for a COVID-19 outbreak as a cumulative 3-week incidence of 10% or more of the detained population. Results. Sixty-three facilities (72%) had at least 1 outbreak. Facilities with any outbreak were significantly more likely to be privately operated (P < .001), to have larger populations (113 vs 37; P = .002), and to have greater changes in their population size over the study period (\u201256% vs -26%; P < .001). Conclusions. Several facility-level factors were associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks in ICE facilities. Public Health Implications. Structural and organizational factors that promote respiratory infection spread in ICE facilities must be addressed to protect detainee health. (Am J Public Health.

To assess the exposure of Chinese adolescents to proalcohol advertising and explore its association with alcohol consumption. Methods. A nationally and regionally representative school-based survey was conducted in mainland China in 2021 among students in grades 7 through 12, aged 13 to 18 years. We assessed adolescent exposure to proalcohol advertising and its association with alcohol consumption. Results. A total of 57 336 students participated in the survey, and the exposure percentage of proalcohol advertising was 66.8%, with no difference between boys and girls or between urban and rural areas. The top 3 exposure channels were television (51.8%), the Internet (43.6%), and outdoor billboards (42.0%). The exposure was higher among students who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (80.1% vs 65.1%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.29) and in the past 12 months (77.3% vs 61.7%; AOR = 1.30). However, no significant correlation was observed between advertising exposure and drunkenness. Conclusions. Approximately two thirds of Chinese adolescents have been exposed to proalcohol advertising in the past 30 days, with television, the Internet, and outdoor billboards being the most prevalent channels. Exposure to proalcohol advertising exhibits a positive correlation with drinking. (Am J Public Health.

To examine the independent and joint effects of state legislation on minimum age for purchasing handguns and background checks on the suicide of young adults aged 18 to 20 years. Methods. We used negative binomial regressions with fixed effects for year and generalized estimating equations for state to estimate the effects of state legislation on annual counts of firearm, nonfirearm, and total young adult suicides in all 50 US states from 1991 to 2020. Results. Minimum age laws decreased the incidence rate of firearm suicide among young adults, an effect that was amplified in states with permit to purchase laws; there was no effect on the nonfirearm or total suicide rate. Permit to purchase laws significantly decreased the young adult firearm suicide incidence rate by 39% (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51, 0.74) and the overall suicide incidence rate by 14% (IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.75, 0.99), with no effect on the nonfirearm suicide rate. Conclusions. Permit to purchase laws are a more promising avenue for reducing young adult suicides than are age-based restrictions. (Am J Public Health.

By reevaluating those claims in light of the history of public health in Great Britain and the United States, we found that better ventilation has frequently been proposed as a cost-effective and nonintrusive means of improving health in institutions experiencing structural and environmental public health problems. Furthermore, our examination of efforts to provide ventilation for enslaved people, incarcerated people, and the urban poor revealed a consistent lack of government regulation and a disassociation of air quality concerns from broader environmental, social, and economic realities.

To determine the percentage of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities that offer HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Methods. We used a retrospective cross-sectional design with data from the National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey, which was administered to directors of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities in 2021. We evaluated the percentage of outpatient substance use treatment facilities offering PrEP and factors associated with the likelihood of offering PrEP. Results. We included 12 182 outpatient substance use treatment facilities. Of these, 637 (5.2%) offered PrEP. Offering HIV treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 45.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.0, 56.9) and offering programs for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning) people (AOR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.6) were associated with higher likelihoods of offering PrEP. Conclusions. PrEP is highly effective and recommended for patients at risk for HIV from injection drug use. Nearly 95% of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities did not offer PrEP-a missed opportunity for harm reduction through primary HIV prevention. Public Health Implications. Diversification of the array of available HIV PrEP options and the ongoing HIV and opioid use epidemics require outpatient substance use treatment facilities to expand PrEP availability.

To demonstrate the spatially uneven effects of abortion restriction laws in Texas. Methods. We used network analysis to determine the change in distance to the nearest surgical abortion provider for 5253 Texas neighborhoods after the passing of Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB8; 2021) and the US Supreme Court#QUOTE#s Dobbs v Jackson Women#QUOTE#s Health Organization (2022) decision. We identified associations between key measures of neighborhood socioeconomic context and change in distance to providers using multivariable linear regression models. Results. After the Dobbs decision, Texas residents experienced an average change in distance to the nearest provider of 457 miles (SD = 179). Neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage experienced the greatest increase in distance to abortion providers after SB8#QUOTE#s passing, and neighborhoods with high levels of income inequality experienced the greatest increase in distance after the Dobbs decision. Conclusions. We document the rapidly changing abortion landscape in a highly restrictive state and show that women living in more disadvantaged and unequal areas are most affected by the increasing distance to providers. Public Health Implications. Our methods and findings will continue to be relevant in understanding the burden placed on women in areas where medical abortion has been restricted because of the Dobbs decision.

We calculated crude pregnancy-associated death rates (deaths per 100 000 live births) by year, cause, and race/ethnicity, percent change in death rate, and the inequity (difference) in rate for each racial or ethnic group compared with non-Hispanic White people. Results. The pregnancy-associated death rate for obstetric, drug-related, homicide, and other causes of death increased during 2020, and obstetric deaths continued to increase in 2021. Overall estimates mask 2021 increases in drug-related deaths among Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), and non-Hispanic Asian people; increases in homicide among most racial and ethnic groups; and increases in suicide among Hispanic, non-Hispanic AI/AN, and non-Hispanic Asian people. Conclusions. We found disproportionate increases in pregnancy-associated deaths from nonobstetric causes among minoritized racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To examine the accessibility of hospital facilities with maternity care services in 1 rural county in Alabama in preparation for the initiation of prenatal care services at a federally qualified health center. Methods. We analyzed driving distance (in miles) from maternal city of residence in Conecuh County, Alabama to hospital of delivery, using 2019-2021 vital statistics data and geographic information system (GIS) software. Results. A total of 370 births to mothers who have home addresses in Conecuh County were reported, and 368 of those were in hospital facilities. The majority of deliveries were less than 30 miles (median = 23 miles) from the maternal city of residence. Some women traveled more than 70 miles for obstetrical care. Conclusions. Pregnant patients in Conecuh County experience significant geographic barriers related to perinatal care access. Using GIS for this analysis is a promising approach to better understand the unique challenges of pregnant individuals in this rural population. Public health policy efforts need to be geographically tailored to address these disparities.

To improve COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant and recently pregnant women from a baseline rate of 30.8% to 60% over 6 months in a marginalized population. Methods. This quality improvement (QI) project was conducted in a federally qualified health center in Western New York between November 2021 and April 2022, using a Lean Six Sigma method. The QI team created a fishbone diagram, process flow map, and driver diagram. Significant barriers were multiple preferred languages, limited health literacy, and a knowledge gap. Increased vaccination rates were the outcome measure. The process measures were attendance at educational events and increased knowledge in community health workers (CHWs) and doulas. Education for CHWs and patients, creating multilingual educational resources, and motivational interviewing sessions for CHWs and patients were the major interventions. We performed data analysis by using weekly run charts and a statistical process control chart. Results. We achieved a sustainable increase in the COVID-19 vaccination rates in women from 30.0% to 48% within 6 months. Conclusions. Patient education in their preferred languages and at health literacy levels and CHWs#QUOTE# engagement played a crucial role in achieving success.

To describe national and city-level fatal drug overdose trends between 2005 and 2021 in Mexico. Methods. We calculated fatal overdose rates at the city level in 3-year periods from 2005 to 2021 and annually at the national level for people aged 15 to 64 years in Mexico. We calculated rate differences and rate ratios for each city between periods. Results. The national fatal overdose rate was 0.53 overdose deaths per 100 000 population and was almost twice as high in urban than in nonurban areas. The national fatal overdose rate was stable over the period 2005 to 2014 and increased monotonically to a peak in 2021. Fatal overdose rates varied across cities. Cities with the 8 highest fatal overdose rates in the period were all in states along the US-Mexico border. Conclusions. Fatal overdoses have doubled over the past 15 years in Mexico. Overdose rates are particularly high and increasing in cities close to the US-Mexico border. Public Health Implications. There is a need for enhanced overdose surveillance data and coordinated harm reduction strategies, particularly in the northern border region of Mexico.

We examine lessons learned from the first decade (2012-2022) of the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, a cornerstone in the VA continuum of homeless services aimed at both preventing homelessness among those at risk and providing rapid rehousing for veterans and their families who are currently experiencing homelessness. Drawing on information from annual reports and other relevant literature, we have identified 3 themes of SSVF that emerged as features to comprehensively deliver support for homeless veterans and their families: (1) responsiveness and flexibility, (2) coordination and integration, and (3) social resource engagement. Using these strategies, SSVF reached nearly three quarters of a million veterans and their families in its first decade, thereby becoming one of the VA#QUOTE#s most substantial programmatic efforts designed to address homelessness. We discuss how each feature might apply to addressing homelessness in the general population as well as future research directions.

To assess heterogeneity in pandemic-period excess fatal overdoses in the United States, by location (state, county) and substance type. Methods. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models to estimate counterfactual death counts in the scenario that no pandemic had occurred. Such estimates were subtracted from actual death counts to assess the magnitude of pandemic-period excess mortality between March 2020 and August 2021. Results. Nationwide, we estimated 25 668 (95% prediction interval [PI] = 2811, 48 524) excess overdose deaths. Specifically, 17 of 47 states and 197 of 592 counties analyzed had statistically significant excess overdose-related mortality. West Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, and New Mexico had the highest rates (20-37 per 100 000). Nationally, there were 5.7 (95% PI = 1.0, 10.4), 3.1 (95% PI = 2.1, 4.2), and 1.4 (95% PI = 0.5, 2.4) excess deaths per 100 000 involving synthetic opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol, respectively. Conclusions. The steep increase in overdose-related mortality affected primarily the southern and western United States. We identified synthetic opioids and psychostimulants as the main contributors. Public Health Implications. Characterizing overdose-related excess mortality across locations and substance types is critical for optimal allocation of public health resources.

We conducted difference-in-differences analyses using individual-level New York Medicaid data to measure traffic injuries and expenditures from 2009 to 2021, comparing NYC to surrounding counties without traffic reforms (n = 65 585 568 person-years). Results. After Vision Zero, injury rates among NYC Medicaid enrollees diverged from those of surrounding counties, with a net impact of 77.5 fewer injuries per 100 000 person-years annually (95% confidence interval = -97.4, -57.6). We observed marked reductions in severe injuries (brain injury, hospitalizations) and savings of $90.8 million in Medicaid expenditures over the first 5 years. Effects were largest among Black residents. Impacts were reversed during the COVID-19 period. Conclusions. Vision Zero resulted in substantial protection for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations known to face heightened risk of injury, but the policy#QUOTE#s effectiveness decreased during the pandemic period. Public Health Implications. Many cities have recently launched Vision Zero policies and others plan to do so.

To evaluate changes in monthly buprenorphine dispensation associated with federal prescribing policies in Washington State from 2012 to 2022. Methods. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis comparing monthly buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed per 1000 population after the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), Substance Use-Disorder Prevention That Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT), and new prescribing rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Buprenorphine formulated for opioid use disorder was included from the Washington State Prescription Monitoring Program. A log-linear autoregressive model measured linear trend changes. Results. Physician prescribing increased by 1.63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41%, 1.85%) per month after CARA with sustained declines after SUPPORT. Nurse practitioner (NP) prescribing increased by 19.48% (95% CI = 18.8%, 20.16%) per month after CARA with physician assistants (PAs) showing similar trends. Following the implementation of SUPPORT, NP and PA trends continued to increase at a reduced growth rate of 3.96% (95% CI = 2.01%, 5.94%) and 1.87% (95% CI = 0.56%, 3.19%), respectively. No prescribers experienced increases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions. CARA nearly tripled the buprenorphine prescribing rate. The SUPPORT Act initiated sustained declines for physician prescribing, and the COVID-19 period reversed gains for PAs and NPs.

A 1-unit increase in economic support policies predicted a 3% average monthly decrease for men (IRR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95, 1.00) and a 4% decrease for women (IRR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.99). All states#QUOTE# policy combinations are predicted to have increased drug-poisoning mortality. Conclusions. The economic supports that states enacted were insufficient to fully mitigate the adverse relationship between activity limitations and drug overdoses.

To test the associations between local employment opportunities for the Black workforce and drug mortality among Black Americans, while examining the potential moderating effects of fentanyl seizure rates. Methods. We derived data from the National Center for Health Statistics#QUOTE# restricted-access Multiple Cause of Death file, linked with county-level job counts, drug supply, and other characteristics from the US Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After examining the characteristics of counties by the magnitudes of increases in drug mortality from 2010\u20122013 to 2018-2021, we conducted a first-differenced regression analysis to test the associations between the job-to-Black workforce ratio and age-adjusted drug mortality rates among Black Americans in US counties and test the moderating effects of state-level fentanyl seizure rates. Results. One more job per 100 Black workers was associated with 0.29 fewer drug overdose deaths per 100 000 Black Americans in the county. This negative association was stronger in the counties of the states with higher increases in fentanyl seizure rates. Conclusions. Increasing employment opportunities can be an important strategy for preventing Black Americans#QUOTE# drug mortality, especially among those living in areas with higher increases in fentanyl seizure rates.

To describe longitudinal trends in the prevalence of mental distress across the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020\u2012April 2021) among US women at the intersection of sexual orientation and racialized group. Methods. Participants included 49 805 cisgender women and female-identified people from the COVID-19 Sub-Study, a cohort of US adults embedded within the Nurses#QUOTE# Health Studies 2 and 3 and the Growing Up Today Study. We fit generalized estimating equation Poisson models to estimate trends in depressive and anxiety symptoms by sexual orientation (gay or lesbian, bisexual, mostly heterosexual, completely heterosexual); subsequent models explored further differences by racialized group (Asian, Black, Latine, White, other or unlisted). Results. Relative to completely heterosexual peers, gay or lesbian, bisexual, and mostly heterosexual women had a higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms at each study wave and experienced widening inequities over time. Inequities were largest for sexual minority women of color, although confidence intervals were wide. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated already-glaring mental health inequities affecting sexual minority women, especially those belonging to marginalized racialized groups. Future research should investigate structural drivers of these patterns to inform policy-oriented interventions.

To examine sudden and unexpected or trauma-related deaths that occurred in the presence of law enforcement in Johnson County, Iowa, between 2011 and 2020. Methods. We identified deaths in the presence of law enforcement using definitions from the National Association of Medical Examiners. We obtained data, including demographics, cause and manner of death, toxicology results, and circumstances and location of event leading to death, from comprehensive medical examiner investigative reports. Results. There were 165 deaths that occurred in the presence of law enforcement: 114 were from a known disease, and 51 were either trauma related or the sudden, unexpected initial presentation of a previously unrecognized disease. Three deaths occurred in the context of physical restraint by law enforcement. Suicide was the leading manner of death among trauma-related deaths; the means of suicide was predictable based on in-custody (hanging) or precustody (firearm) circumstances. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the potential role of medical examiners and coroners in improving completeness of data on reporting death in the presence of law enforcement to public health agencies.

Although many health systems routinely screen patients for social concerns, few health systems achieve the recommended model of integration. In this critical case study in an urban safety net health system, we describe the human capital, operational redesign, and financial investment needed to implement the National Academy recommendations. Using data from this case study, we estimate that other health systems seeking to build and maintain this infrastructure would need to invest $1 million to $3 million per year. While health systems with robust existing resources may be able to bootstrap short-term funding to initiate this work, we conclude that long-term investments by insurers and other payers will be necessary for most health systems to achieve the recommended integration of medical and social care. Researchers seeking to test whether integrating social and medical care leads to better patient and population outcomes require access to health systems and communities who have already invested in this model infrastructure.

We describe the main ways of presenting excess mortality: as a mortality rate (incidence rate) or as a percentage increase (relative risk or rate ratio). We discuss what should be regarded as the null value of excess mortality (i.e., when countries or regions can be judged as having fared equally well) and when age and sex standardization, adjustment for other determinants of the spread of a pandemic, or both is necessary. We discuss the level of detail by time and place and person that may be necessary. We note that an excess mortality comparison is essentially a difference-in-differences analysis. We conclude that, although one cannot rule out using excess mortality analyses for causal effect estimates, such analyses will remain most fruitful for generating hypotheses about both the efficiency of measures to curtail the pandemic and factors that cannot be influenced. Nevertheless, a judicious use of arguments and counterarguments can then lead to identifying best practices for various situations.

Qualitative methods were used to analyze survey and meeting data from 2022 for RADx-UP projects. Most projects had diverse partners, achieved moderate levels of community engagement, and experienced positive outcomes. Challenges related to engagement readiness and partnership functioning. These findings demonstrate that community engagement is measurable and valuable. However, additional support is needed to achieve the highest engagement.
