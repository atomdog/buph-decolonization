Although these species have avoided the immediate extinction threat, their long-term viability remains precarious due to the potential genetic consequences of population declines, which are poorly understood on a timescale beyond a few generations. Woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) became isolated on Wrangel Island around 10,000 years ago and persisted for over 200 generations before becoming extinct around 4,000 years ago. To study the evolutionary processes leading up to the mammoths#QUOTE# extinction, we analyzed 21 Siberian woolly mammoth genomes. Our results show that the population recovered quickly from a severe bottleneck and remained demographically stable during the ensuing six millennia. We find that mildly deleterious mutations gradually accumulated, whereas highly deleterious mutations were purged, suggesting ongoing inbreeding depression that lasted for hundreds of generations. The time-lag between demographic and genetic recovery has wide-ranging implications for conservation management of recently bottlenecked populations.

Functioning as a signaling hub within the cell, mitochondria integrate information from various intracellular compartments to regulate cellular signaling and metabolism. Multiple studies have shown that mitochondria may respond to various extracellular signaling events. However, it is less clear how changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) can impact mitochondrial homeostasis to regulate animal physiology. We find that ECM remodeling alters mitochondrial homeostasis in an evolutionarily conserved manner. Mechanistically, ECM remodeling triggers a TGF-\u03b2 response to induce mitochondrial fission and the unfolded protein response of the mitochondria (UPRMT). At the organismal level, ECM remodeling promotes defense of animals against pathogens through enhanced mitochondrial stress responses. We postulate that this ECM-mitochondria crosstalk represents an ancient immune pathway, which detects infection- or mechanical-stress-induced ECM damage, thereby initiating adaptive mitochondria-based immune and metabolic responses.

One such secreted factor, the complement protein C1q, contributes to complement-mediated synapse elimination in both developmental and disease models, yet brain C1q protein levels increase significantly throughout aging. Here, we report that C1q interacts with neuronal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in an age-dependent manner. Purified C1q protein undergoes RNA-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, and the interaction of C1q with neuronal RNP complexes in vivo is dependent on RNA and endocytosis. Mice lacking C1q have age-specific alterations in neuronal protein synthesis in vivo and impaired fear memory extinction.

While the constituents of biomolecular condensates are generally well documented, the mechanisms underlying their formation under stress are only partially understood. Here, we show in yeast that covalent modification with the ubiquitin-like modifier Urm1 promotes the phase separation of a wide range of proteins. We find that the drop in cellular pH induced by stress triggers Urm1 self-association and its interaction with both target proteins and the Urm1-conjugating enzyme Uba4. Urmylation of stress-sensitive proteins promotes their deposition into stress granules and nuclear condensates. Yeast cells lacking Urm1 exhibit condensate defects that manifest in reduced stress resilience. We propose that Urm1 acts as a reversible molecular #QUOTE#adhesive#QUOTE# to drive protective phase separation of functionally critical proteins under cellular stress.

Antibodies targeting IL-23 and IL-17 have shown clinical efficacy but are limited by high costs, safety risks, lack of sustained efficacy, and poor patient convenience as they require parenteral administration. Here, we present designed miniproteins inhibiting IL-23R and IL-17 with antibody-like, low picomolar affinities at a fraction of the molecular size. The minibinders potently block cell signaling in vitro and are extremely stable, enabling oral administration and low-cost manufacturing. The orally administered IL-23R minibinder shows efficacy better than a clinical anti-IL-23 antibody in mouse colitis and has a favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution profile in rats. This work demonstrates that orally administered de novo-designed minibinders can reach a therapeutic target past the gut epithelial barrier. With high potency, gut stability, and straightforward manufacturability, de novo-designed minibinders are a promising modality for oral biologics.

We develop a framework to detect perturbation-dependent changes in polyadenylation and characterize modules of co-regulated polyA sites. We find groups of intronic polyA sites regulated by distinct components of the nuclear RNA life cycle, including elongation, splicing, termination, and surveillance. We train and validate a deep neural network (APARENT-Perturb) for tandem polyA site usage, delineating a cis-regulatory code that predicts perturbation response and reveals interactions between regulatory complexes.

During this time, the embryo maintains a window of plasticity and can redirect its cellular fate when challenged experimentally. In this context, we found that the PrE alone was sufficient to regenerate a complete blastocyst and continue post-implantation development. We identify an in vitro population similar to the early PrE in vivo that exhibits the same embryonic and extra-embryonic potency and can form complete stem cell-based embryo models, termed blastoids. Commitment in the PrE is suppressed by JAK/STAT signaling, collaborating with OCT4 and the sustained expression of a subset of pluripotency-related transcription factors that safeguard an enhancer landscape permissive for multi-lineage differentiation. Our observations support the notion that transcription factor persistence underlies plasticity in regulative development and highlight the importance of the PrE in perturbed development.

Here, we report Open-ST, a sequencing-based, open-source experimental and computational resource to address these challenges and to study the molecular organization of tissues in 2D and 3D. In mouse brain, Open-ST captured transcripts at subcellular resolution and reconstructed cell types. In primary head-and-neck tumors and patient-matched healthy/metastatic lymph nodes, Open-ST captured the diversity of immune, stromal, and tumor populations in space, validated by imaging-based ST. Distinct cell states were organized around cell-cell communication hotspots in the tumor but not the metastasis. Strikingly, the 3D reconstruction and multimodal analysis of the metastatic lymph node revealed spatially contiguous structures not visible in 2D and potential biomarkers precisely at the 3D tumor/lymph node boundary.

Though 70% of human lifespan variance remains unexplained by heritable factors, little is known about the intrinsic sources of physiologic heterogeneity in aging. To understand how complex physiologic networks generate lifespan variation, new methods are needed. Here, we present Asynch-seq, an approach that uses gene-expression heterogeneity within isogenic populations to study the processes generating lifespan variation. By collecting thousands of single-individual transcriptomes, we capture the Caenorhabditis elegans #QUOTE#pan-transcriptome#QUOTE#-a highly resolved atlas of non-genetic variation. We use our atlas to guide a large-scale perturbation screen that identifies the decoupling of total mRNA content between germline and soma as the largest source of physiologic heterogeneity in aging, driven by pleiotropic genes whose knockdown dramatically reduces lifespan variance. Our work demonstrates how systematic mapping of physiologic heterogeneity can be applied to reduce inter-individual disparities in aging.

Besides its traditional function in telomere synthesis, TERT acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of genes pivotal in aging and age-associated diseases. Here, we report the identification of a TERT activator compound (TAC) that upregulates TERT transcription via the MEK/ERK/AP-1 cascade. In primary human cells and naturally aged mice, TAC-induced elevation of TERT levels promotes telomere synthesis, blunts tissue aging hallmarks with reduced cellular senescence and inflammatory cytokines, and silences p16INK4a expression via upregulation of DNMT3B-mediated promoter hypermethylation. In the brain, TAC alleviates neuroinflammation, increases neurotrophic factors, stimulates adult neurogenesis, and preserves cognitive function without evident toxicity, including cancer risk. Together, these findings underscore TERT#QUOTE#s critical role in aging processes and provide preclinical proof of concept for physiological TERT activation as a strategy to mitigate multiple aging hallmarks and associated pathologies.

Based on metagenomics (MG) sequencing of 245 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient feces, we constructed species-level co-abundance networks that were clustered into species-interacting groups (SIGs) correlating with overall survival. Thirty-seven and forty-five MG species (MGSs) were associated with resistance (SIG1) and response (SIG2) to ICIs, respectively. When combined with the quantification of Akkermansia species, this procedure allowed a person-based calculation of a topological score (TOPOSCORE) that was validated in an additional 254 NSCLC patients and in 216 genitourinary cancer patients. Finally, this TOPOSCORE was translated into a 21-bacterial probe set-based qPCR scoring that was validated in a prospective cohort of NSCLC patients as well as in colorectal and melanoma patients. This approach could represent a dynamic diagnosis tool for intestinal dysbiosis to guide personalized microbiota-centered interventions.

How cells adapt to recover and resume growth remains poorly understood. Here, we visualized budding yeast cells undergoing meiosis by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and discovered elaborate filamentous assemblies decorating the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. To determine filament composition, we developed a #QUOTE#filament identification#QUOTE# (FilamentID) workflow that combines multiscale cryoET/cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) analyses of partially lysed cells or organelles. FilamentID identified the mitochondrial filaments as being composed of the conserved aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald4ALDH2 and the nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic filaments as consisting of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase Acs1ACSS2. Structural characterization further revealed the mechanism underlying polymerization and enabled us to genetically perturb filament formation. Acs1 polymerization facilitates the recovery of chronologically aged spores and, more generally, the cell cycle re-entry of starved cells. FilamentID is broadly applicable to characterize filaments of unknown identity in diverse cellular contexts.

We review current knowledge on the principles and mechanisms of self-organized patterning in embryonic tissues and explore how these principles and mechanisms apply to adult tissues that exhibit features of patterning. We discuss how and why spontaneous pattern generation is integral to homeostasis and healing of tissues, illustrating it with examples from regenerative biology.

Our study analyzed co-signaling receptors during hepatocellular priming and traced the trajectory and fate of dysfunctional HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Early on, these cells upregulate PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, OX40, 4-1BB, and ICOS. While blocking co-inhibitory receptors had minimal effect, activating 4-1BB and OX40 converted them into antiviral effectors. Prolonged stimulation led to a self-renewing, long-lived, heterogeneous population with a unique transcriptional profile. This includes dysfunctional progenitor/stem-like (TSL) cells and two distinct dysfunctional tissue-resident memory (TRM) populations. While 4-1BB expression is ubiquitously maintained, OX40 expression is limited to TSL. In chronic settings, only 4-1BB stimulation conferred antiviral activity. In HBeAg+ chronic patients, 4-1BB activation showed the highest potential to rejuvenate dysfunctional CD8+ T cells. Targeting all dysfunctional T cells, rather than only stem-like precursors, holds promise for treating chronic HBV infection.

We employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate transgenic locusts expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP in olfactory sensory neurons. Using two-photon functional imaging, we mapped the spatial activation patterns representing a wide range of ecologically relevant odors across all six developmental stages. Our findings reveal a functionally ring-shaped organization of the antennal lobe composed of specific glomerular clusters. This configuration establishes an odor-specific chemotopic representation by encoding different chemical classes and ecologically distinct odors in the form of glomerular rings. The ring-shaped glomerular arrangement, which we confirm by selective targeting of OR70a-expressing sensory neurons, occurs throughout development, and the odor-coding pattern within the glomerular population is consistent across developmental stages. Mechanistically, this unconventional spatial olfactory code reflects the locust-specific and multiplexed glomerular innervation pattern of the antennal lobe.

The >66,000 rove beetle species (Staphylinidae) form the largest metazoan family. Combining genomic and cell type transcriptomic insights spanning the largest clade, Aleocharinae, we retrace evolution of two cell types comprising a defensive gland-a putative catalyst behind staphylinid megadiversity. We identify molecular evolutionary steps leading to benzoquinone production by one cell type via a mechanism convergent with plant toxin release systems, and synthesis by the second cell type of a solvent that weaponizes the total secretion. This cooperative system has been conserved since the Early Cretaceous as Aleocharinae radiated into tens of thousands of lineages. Reprogramming each cell type yielded biochemical novelties enabling ecological specialization-most dramatically in symbionts that infiltrate social insect colonies via host-manipulating secretions.

Here, we describe an iterative, comparative metabolomics pipeline to uncover microbial metabolic features in the complex setting of a host and apply it to investigate gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI) in patients. We find elevated levels of bacterially derived acetylated polyamines during BSI and discover the enzyme responsible for their production (SpeG). Blocking SpeG activity reduces bacterial proliferation and slows pathogenesis. Reduction of SpeG activity also enhances bacterial membrane permeability and increases intracellular antibiotic accumulation, allowing us to overcome AMR in culture and in vivo.

By dissecting the neuronal inflammatory stress response, we discovered that neurons in MS and its mouse model induce the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). However, activation of neuronal STING requires its detachment from the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a process triggered by glutamate excitotoxicity. This detachment initiates non-canonical STING signaling, which leads to autophagic degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), essential for neuronal redox homeostasis and thereby inducing ferroptosis. Both genetic and pharmacological interventions that target STING in neurons protect against inflammation-induced neurodegeneration. Our findings position STING as a central regulator of the detrimental neuronal inflammatory stress response, integrating inflammation with glutamate signaling to cause neuronal cell death, and present it as a tractable target for treating neurodegeneration in MS.

NLRC5 is an enigmatic NLR with mutations associated with inflammatory and infectious diseases, but little is known about its function as an innate immune sensor and cell death regulator. Therefore, we screened for NLRC5#QUOTE#s role in response to infections, PAMPs, DAMPs, and cytokines. We identified that NLRC5 acts as an innate immune sensor to drive inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in response to specific ligands, including PAMP/heme and heme/cytokine combinations. NLRC5 interacted with NLRP12 and PANoptosome components to form a cell death complex, suggesting an NLR network forms similar to those in plants. Mechanistically, TLR signaling and NAD+ levels regulated NLRC5 expression and ROS production to control cell death. Furthermore, NLRC5-deficient mice were protected in hemolytic and inflammatory models, suggesting that NLRC5 could be a potential therapeutic target.

Pathogens binding to host extracellular proteins (the #QUOTE#exoproteome#QUOTE#) represents a crucial interface in the etiology of vector-borne disease. Here, we used bacterial selection to elucidate host-microbe interactions in high throughput (BASEHIT)-a technique enabling interrogation of microbial interactions with 3,324 human exoproteins-to profile the interactomes of 82 human-pathogen samples, including 30 strains of arthropod-borne pathogens and 8 strains of related non-vector-borne pathogens. The resulting atlas revealed 1,303 putative interactions, including hundreds of pairings with potential roles in pathogenesis, including cell invasion, tissue colonization, immune evasion, and host sensing. Subsequent functional investigations uncovered that Lyme disease spirochetes recognize epidermal growth factor as an environmental cue of transcriptional regulation and that conserved interactions between intracellular pathogens and thioredoxins facilitate cell invasion. In summary, this interactome atlas provides molecular-level insights into microbial pathogenesis and reveals potential host-directed targets for next-generation therapeutics.

In this study, we found that PD-1 and CTLA4-based cancer immunotherapies are unable to eradicate tumors in elderly mice. This defect in anti-tumor activity correlated with two known age-associated immune defects: diminished abundance of systemic naive CD8+ T cells and weak migratory activities of dendritic cells (DCs). We identified a vaccine adjuvant, referred to as a DC hyperactivator, which corrects DC migratory defects in the elderly. Vaccines containing tumor antigens and DC hyperactivators induced T helper type 1 (TH1) CD4+ T cells with cytolytic activity that drive anti-tumor immunity in elderly mice. When administered early in life, DC hyperactivators were the only adjuvant identified that elicited anti-tumor CD4+ T cells that persisted into old age. These results raise the possibility of correcting age-associated immune defects through DC manipulation.

Replication initiation entails the assembly and activation of two CMG helicases (Cdc45\u22c5Mcm2-7\u22c5GINS) at each origin. This requires several replication firing factors (including TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON) whose exact roles are still under debate. How two helicases are correctly assembled and activated at each origin is a long-standing question. By visualizing the recruitment of GINS, Cdc45, TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON in real time, we uncovered that replication initiation is surprisingly dynamic. First, TopBP1 transiently binds to the origin and dissociates before the start of DNA synthesis. Second, two Cdc45 are recruited together, even though Cdc45 alone cannot dimerize. Next, two copies of DONSON and two GINS simultaneously arrive at the origin, completing the assembly of two CMG helicases. Finally, RecQL4 is recruited to the CMG\u22c5DONSON\u22c5DONSON\u22c5CMG complex and promotes DONSON dissociation and CMG activation via its ATPase activity.

Among the three evolutionarily distinct hydrogenase superfamilies responsible, [FeFe] hydrogenases were thought to be restricted to bacteria and eukaryotes. Here, we show that anaerobic archaea encode diverse, active, and ancient lineages of [FeFe] hydrogenases through combining analysis of existing and new genomes with extensive biochemical experiments. [FeFe] hydrogenases are encoded by genomes of nine archaeal phyla and expressed by H2-producing Asgard archaeon cultures. We report an ultraminimal hydrogenase in DPANN archaea that binds the catalytic H-cluster and produces H2. Moreover, we identify and characterize remarkable hybrid complexes formed through the fusion of [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases in ten other archaeal orders. Phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling suggest a deep evolutionary history of hybrid hydrogenases. These findings reveal new metabolic adaptations of archaea, streamlined H2 catalysts for biotechnological development, and a surprisingly intertwined evolutionary history between the two major H2-metabolizing enzymes.

However, an unresolved challenge is the extensive cell death following transplantation. Here, we performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screen to enhance postmitotic dopamine neuron survival in vivo. We identified p53-mediated apoptotic cell death as a major contributor to dopamine neuron loss and uncovered a causal link of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling in limiting cell survival. As a translationally relevant strategy to purify postmitotic dopamine neurons, we identified cell surface markers that enable purification without the need for genetic reporters. Combining cell sorting and treatment with adalimumab, a clinically approved TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, enabled efficient engraftment of postmitotic dopamine neurons with extensive reinnervation and functional recovery in a preclinical PD mouse model. Thus, transient TNF-\u03b1 inhibition presents a clinically relevant strategy to enhance survival and enable engraftment of postmitotic hPSC-derived dopamine neurons in PD.

To enable systematic exploration of how receptor valency and geometry affect signaling outcomes, we designed cyclic homo-oligomers with up to 8 subunits using repeat protein building blocks that can be modularly extended. By incorporating a de novo-designed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-binding module into these scaffolds, we generated a series of synthetic signaling ligands that exhibit potent valency- and geometry-dependent Ca2+ release and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. The high specificity of the designed agonists reveals distinct roles for two FGFR splice variants in driving arterial endothelium and perivascular cell fates during early vascular development.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking mitochondrial membrane remodeling and quality control to mtDNA copy number (CN) regulation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1) negatively regulates IMM fusion. Moreover, manipulation of mitochondrial fusion through the regulation of MTFP1 levels results in mtDNA CN modulation. Mechanistically, we found that MTFP1 inhibits mitochondrial fusion to isolate and exclude damaged IMM subdomains from the rest of the network. Subsequently, peripheral fission ensures their segregation into small MTFP1-enriched mitochondria (SMEM) that are targeted for degradation in an autophagic-dependent manner. Remarkably, MTFP1-dependent IMM quality control is essential for basal nucleoid recycling and therefore to maintain adequate mtDNA levels within the cell.

However, previous studies have indicated that Lgr5+ cells are dispensable for intestinal regeneration, leading to two major hypotheses: one favoring the presence of a quiescent reserve ISC and the other calling for differentiated cell plasticity. To investigate these possibilities, we studied crypt epithelial cells in an unbiased fashion via high-resolution single-cell profiling. These studies, combined with in vivo lineage tracing, show that Lgr5 is not a specific ISC marker and that stemness potential exists beyond the crypt base and resides in the isthmus region, where undifferentiated cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and regeneration following irradiation (IR) injury. Our results provide an alternative model of intestinal epithelial cell organization, suggesting that stemness potential is not restricted to CBC cells, and neither de-differentiation nor reserve ISC are drivers of intestinal regeneration.

Here, we identify a proliferative upper crypt population marked by Fgfbp1, in the location of putative TA cells, that is transcriptionally distinct from Lgr5+ cells. Using a kinetic reporter for time-resolved fate mapping and Fgfbp1-CreERT2 lineage tracing, we establish that Fgfbp1+ cells are multi-potent and give rise to Lgr5+ cells, consistent with their ISC function. Fgfbp1+ cells also sustain epithelial regeneration following Lgr5+ cell depletion. We demonstrate that FGFBP1, produced by the upper crypt cells, is an essential factor for crypt proliferation and epithelial homeostasis. Our findings support a model in which tissue regeneration originates from upper crypt Fgfbp1+ cells that generate progeny propagating bi-directionally along the crypt-villus axis and serve as a source of Lgr5+ cells in the crypt base.

AMPSphere provides insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides, including by duplication or gene truncation of longer sequences, and we observed that AMP production varies by habitat. To validate our predictions, we synthesized and tested 100 AMPs against clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens and human gut commensals both in vitro and in vivo. A total of 79 peptides were active, with 63 targeting pathogens. These active AMPs exhibited antibacterial activity by disrupting bacterial membranes. In conclusion, our approach identified nearly one million prokaryotic AMP sequences, an open-access resource for antibiotic discovery.

However, the relative contributions, timing, and regulation of these pathways in determining cell fate is unclear. Here we use time-resolved phosphoproteomic, chemical-genetic, single-cell imaging, and biochemical approaches to create a chronological atlas of signaling events activated in cells responding to UV damage. We discover that UV-induced apoptosis is mediated by the RSR kinase ZAK and not through the DDR. We identify two negative-feedback modules that regulate ZAK-mediated apoptosis: (1) GCN2 activation limits ribosomal collisions and attenuates ZAK-mediated RSR and (2) ZAK activity leads to phosphodegron autophosphorylation and its subsequent degradation. These events tune ZAK#QUOTE#s activity to collision levels to establish regimes of homeostasis, tolerance, and death, revealing its key role as the cellular sentinel for nucleic acid damage.

The mean systolic blood pressure throughout the follow-up (except the first 3 months of titration) was 119\u00b71 mm Hg (SD 11\u00b71) in the intensive treatment group and 134\u00b78 mm Hg (10\u00b75) in the standard treatment group. During a median of 3\u00b74 years of follow-up, the primary outcome event occurred in 547 (9\u00b77%) participants in the intensive treatment group and 623 (11\u00b71%) in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b788, 95% CI 0\u00b778-0\u00b799; p=0\u00b7028). There was no heterogeneity of effects by diabetes status, duration of diabetes, or history of stroke. Serious adverse events of syncope occurred more frequently in the intensive treatment group (24 [0\u00b74%] of 5624) than in standard treatment group (eight [0\u00b71%] of 5631; HR 3\u00b700, 95% CI 1\u00b735-6\u00b768). There was no significant between-group difference in the serious adverse events of hypotension, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, or acute kidney injury.              Interpretation:                    For hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, regardless of the status of diabetes or history of stroke, the treatment strategy of targeting systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with that of less than 140 mm Hg, prevents major vascular events, with minor excess risk.

However, the best endometrial preparation protocol for FET cycles is unclear. We compared natural and modified natural cycle strategies with an artificial cycle strategy for endometrial preparation before FET.              Methods:                    In this randomised, open-label study, we recruited ovulatory women aged 18-45 years at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, who were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to natural, modified natural, or artificial cycle endometrial preparation using a computer-generated random list and block randomisation. The trial was not masked due to the nature of the study interventions. In natural cycles, no oestrogen, progesterone, or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was used. In modified natural cycles, hCG was used to trigger ovulation. In artificial cycles, oral oestradiol valerate (8 mg/day from day 2-4 of menstruation) and vaginal progesterone (800 mg/day starting when endometrial thickness was \u22657 mm) were used. Embryos were vitrified, and then one or two day-3 embryos or one day-5 embryo were warmed and transferred under ultrasound guidance. If the first FET cycle was cancelled, subsequent cycles were performed with artificial endometrial preparation. The primary endpoint was livebirth after one FET. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04804020.              Findings:                    Between March 22, 2021, and March 14, 2023, 4779 women were screened and 1428 were randomly assigned (476 to each group). 99 first FET cycles were cancelled in each of the natural and modified cycle groups, versus none in the artificial cycle group. The livebirth rate after one FET was 174 (37%) of 476 in the natural cycle strategy group, 159 (33%) of 476 in the modified natural cycle strategy group, and 162 (34%) of 476 in the artificial cycle strategy group (relative risk 1\u00b707 [95% CI 0\u00b787-1\u00b733] for natural vs artificial cycle strategy, and 0\u00b798 [0\u00b779-1\u00b722] for modified natural vs artificial cycle strategy). Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between groups, as the power to detect small differences was low.              Interpretation:                    Although the livebirth rate was similar after natural, modified natural, and artificial cycle endometrial preparation strategies in ovulatory women undergoing FET IVF, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding the comparative safety of the three approaches.

Compared with advances achieved for other serious neonatal and early childhood conditions globally, progress in reducing neonatal sepsis has been much slower, especially in low-resource settings that have the highest burden of neonatal sepsis morbidity and mortality. By contrast to sepsis in older patients, there is no universally accepted neonatal sepsis definition. This poses substantial challenges in clinical practice, research, and health-care management, and has direct practical implications, such as diagnostic inconsistency, heterogeneous data collection and surveillance, and inappropriate treatment, health-resource allocation, and education.

Early pregnancy lifestyle intervention could prevent late gestational diabetes. Early gestational diabetes diagnosis and treatment has been shown to be beneficial, especially when identified before 14 weeks of gestation. Early gestational diabetes screening now requires strategies for integration into routine antenatal care, alongside efforts to reduce variation in gestational diabetes care, across settings that differ between, and within, countries. Following gestational diabetes, an oral glucose tolerance test should be performed 6-12 weeks postpartum to assess the glycaemic state. Subsequent regular screening for both dysglycaemia and cardiometabolic disease is recommended, which can be incorporated alongside other family health activities. Diabetes prevention programmes for women with previous gestational diabetes might be enhanced using shared decision making and precision medicine.

Gestational diabetes direct costs are US$1\u00b76 billion in the USA alone, largely due to complications including hypertensive disorders, preterm delivery, and neonatal metabolic and respiratory consequences. Between 30% and 70% of gestational diabetes is diagnosed in early pregnancy (ie, early gestational diabetes defined by hyperglycaemia before 20 weeks of gestation). Early gestational diabetes is associated with worse pregnancy outcomes compared with women diagnosed with late gestational diabetes (hyperglycaemia from 24 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation). Randomised controlled trials show benefits of treating gestational diabetes from 24 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation. The WHO 2013 recommendations for diagnosing gestational diabetes (one-step 75 gm 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation) are largely based on the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Study, which confirmed the linear association between pregnancy complications and late-pregnancy maternal glycaemia: a phenomenon that has now also been shown in early pregnancy.

Historically, gestational diabetes was considered a pregnancy complication involving treatment of rising glycaemia late in the second trimester. However, recent evidence challenges this view. Pre-pregnancy and pregnancy-specific factors influence gestational glycaemia, with open questions regarding roles of non-glycaemic factors in the aetiology and consequences of gestational diabetes. Varying patterns of insulin secretion and resistance in early and late pregnancy underlie a heterogeneity of gestational diabetes in the timing and pathophysiological subtypes with clinical implications: early gestational diabetes and insulin resistant gestational diabetes subtypes are associated with a higher risk of pregnancy complications. Metabolic perturbations of early gestational diabetes can affect early placental development, affecting maternal metabolism and fetal development. Fetal hyperinsulinaemia can affect the development of multiple fetal tissues, with short-term and long-term consequences. Pregnancy complications are prevented by managing glycaemia in early and late pregnancy in some, but not all women with gestational diabetes.

To determine facility-level factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. Methods. We obtained COVID-19 case counts at 88 ICE detention facilities from May 6, 2020, through June 21, 2021, from the COVID Prison Project. We obtained information about facility population size, facility type (dedicated to immigrants or mixed with other incarcerated populations), and facility operator (public vs private contractor) from third-party sources. We defined the threshold for a COVID-19 outbreak as a cumulative 3-week incidence of 10% or more of the detained population. Results. Sixty-three facilities (72%) had at least 1 outbreak. Facilities with any outbreak were significantly more likely to be privately operated (P < .001), to have larger populations (113 vs 37; P = .002), and to have greater changes in their population size over the study period (\u201256% vs -26%; P < .001). Conclusions. Several facility-level factors were associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 outbreaks in ICE facilities. Public Health Implications. Structural and organizational factors that promote respiratory infection spread in ICE facilities must be addressed to protect detainee health. (Am J Public Health.

To assess the exposure of Chinese adolescents to proalcohol advertising and explore its association with alcohol consumption. Methods. A nationally and regionally representative school-based survey was conducted in mainland China in 2021 among students in grades 7 through 12, aged 13 to 18 years. We assessed adolescent exposure to proalcohol advertising and its association with alcohol consumption. Results. A total of 57 336 students participated in the survey, and the exposure percentage of proalcohol advertising was 66.8%, with no difference between boys and girls or between urban and rural areas. The top 3 exposure channels were television (51.8%), the Internet (43.6%), and outdoor billboards (42.0%). The exposure was higher among students who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (80.1% vs 65.1%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.29) and in the past 12 months (77.3% vs 61.7%; AOR = 1.30). However, no significant correlation was observed between advertising exposure and drunkenness. Conclusions. Approximately two thirds of Chinese adolescents have been exposed to proalcohol advertising in the past 30 days, with television, the Internet, and outdoor billboards being the most prevalent channels. Exposure to proalcohol advertising exhibits a positive correlation with drinking. (Am J Public Health.

To examine the independent and joint effects of state legislation on minimum age for purchasing handguns and background checks on the suicide of young adults aged 18 to 20 years. Methods. We used negative binomial regressions with fixed effects for year and generalized estimating equations for state to estimate the effects of state legislation on annual counts of firearm, nonfirearm, and total young adult suicides in all 50 US states from 1991 to 2020. Results. Minimum age laws decreased the incidence rate of firearm suicide among young adults, an effect that was amplified in states with permit to purchase laws; there was no effect on the nonfirearm or total suicide rate. Permit to purchase laws significantly decreased the young adult firearm suicide incidence rate by 39% (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51, 0.74) and the overall suicide incidence rate by 14% (IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.75, 0.99), with no effect on the nonfirearm suicide rate. Conclusions. Permit to purchase laws are a more promising avenue for reducing young adult suicides than are age-based restrictions. (Am J Public Health.

In popular press articles, bestselling books, and the US Environmental Protection Agency#QUOTE#s recently announced Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, scholars and policy experts have claimed that improved ventilation systems can lead to better productivity and performance. By reevaluating those claims in light of the history of public health in Great Britain and the United States, we found that better ventilation has frequently been proposed as a cost-effective and nonintrusive means of improving health in institutions experiencing structural and environmental public health problems. Furthermore, our examination of efforts to provide ventilation for enslaved people, incarcerated people, and the urban poor revealed a consistent lack of government regulation and a disassociation of air quality concerns from broader environmental, social, and economic realities. By continuing to ignore these broader contexts, current ventilation efforts risk repeating this pattern. (Am J Public Health.

To determine the percentage of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities that offer HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Methods. We used a retrospective cross-sectional design with data from the National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey, which was administered to directors of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities in 2021. We evaluated the percentage of outpatient substance use treatment facilities offering PrEP and factors associated with the likelihood of offering PrEP. Results. We included 12 182 outpatient substance use treatment facilities. Of these, 637 (5.2%) offered PrEP. Offering HIV treatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 45.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.0, 56.9) and offering programs for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning) people (AOR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.6) were associated with higher likelihoods of offering PrEP. Conclusions. PrEP is highly effective and recommended for patients at risk for HIV from injection drug use. Nearly 95% of US outpatient substance use treatment facilities did not offer PrEP-a missed opportunity for harm reduction through primary HIV prevention. Public Health Implications. Diversification of the array of available HIV PrEP options and the ongoing HIV and opioid use epidemics require outpatient substance use treatment facilities to expand PrEP availability.

To demonstrate the spatially uneven effects of abortion restriction laws in Texas. Methods. We used network analysis to determine the change in distance to the nearest surgical abortion provider for 5253 Texas neighborhoods after the passing of Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB8; 2021) and the US Supreme Court#QUOTE#s Dobbs v Jackson Women#QUOTE#s Health Organization (2022) decision. We identified associations between key measures of neighborhood socioeconomic context and change in distance to providers using multivariable linear regression models. Results. After the Dobbs decision, Texas residents experienced an average change in distance to the nearest provider of 457 miles (SD = 179). Neighborhoods of concentrated disadvantage experienced the greatest increase in distance to abortion providers after SB8#QUOTE#s passing, and neighborhoods with high levels of income inequality experienced the greatest increase in distance after the Dobbs decision. Conclusions. We document the rapidly changing abortion landscape in a highly restrictive state and show that women living in more disadvantaged and unequal areas are most affected by the increasing distance to providers.

Our methods and findings will continue to be relevant in understanding the burden placed on women in areas where medical abortion has been restricted because of the Dobbs decision.

To examine changes in cause-specific pregnancy-associated deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity and assess changes in racial and ethnic inequities in pregnancy-associated deaths. Methods. We used US vital statistics mortality data from 2018 to 2021 to identify pregnancy-associated deaths among females aged 15 to 44 years. We calculated crude pregnancy-associated death rates (deaths per 100 000 live births) by year, cause, and race/ethnicity, percent change in death rate, and the inequity (difference) in rate for each racial or ethnic group compared with non-Hispanic White people. Results. The pregnancy-associated death rate for obstetric, drug-related, homicide, and other causes of death increased during 2020, and obstetric deaths continued to increase in 2021. Overall estimates mask 2021 increases in drug-related deaths among Hispanic, non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), and non-Hispanic Asian people; increases in homicide among most racial and ethnic groups; and increases in suicide among Hispanic, non-Hispanic AI/AN, and non-Hispanic Asian people. Conclusions. We found disproportionate increases in pregnancy-associated deaths from nonobstetric causes among minoritized racial and ethnic groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To examine the accessibility of hospital facilities with maternity care services in 1 rural county in Alabama in preparation for the initiation of prenatal care services at a federally qualified health center. Methods. We analyzed driving distance (in miles) from maternal city of residence in Conecuh County, Alabama to hospital of delivery, using 2019-2021 vital statistics data and geographic information system (GIS) software. Results. A total of 370 births to mothers who have home addresses in Conecuh County were reported, and 368 of those were in hospital facilities. The majority of deliveries were less than 30 miles (median = 23 miles) from the maternal city of residence. Some women traveled more than 70 miles for obstetrical care. Conclusions. Pregnant patients in Conecuh County experience significant geographic barriers related to perinatal care access. Using GIS for this analysis is a promising approach to better understand the unique challenges of pregnant individuals in this rural population. Public health policy efforts need to be geographically tailored to address these disparities.

To improve COVID-19 vaccination rates in pregnant and recently pregnant women from a baseline rate of 30.8% to 60% over 6 months in a marginalized population. Methods. This quality improvement (QI) project was conducted in a federally qualified health center in Western New York between November 2021 and April 2022, using a Lean Six Sigma method. The QI team created a fishbone diagram, process flow map, and driver diagram. Significant barriers were multiple preferred languages, limited health literacy, and a knowledge gap. Increased vaccination rates were the outcome measure. The process measures were attendance at educational events and increased knowledge in community health workers (CHWs) and doulas. Education for CHWs and patients, creating multilingual educational resources, and motivational interviewing sessions for CHWs and patients were the major interventions. We performed data analysis by using weekly run charts and a statistical process control chart. Results. We achieved a sustainable increase in the COVID-19 vaccination rates in women from 30.0% to 48% within 6 months. Conclusions. Patient education in their preferred languages and at health literacy levels and CHWs#QUOTE# engagement played a crucial role in achieving success.

To describe national and city-level fatal drug overdose trends between 2005 and 2021 in Mexico. Methods. We calculated fatal overdose rates at the city level in 3-year periods from 2005 to 2021 and annually at the national level for people aged 15 to 64 years in Mexico. We calculated rate differences and rate ratios for each city between periods. Results. The national fatal overdose rate was 0.53 overdose deaths per 100 000 population and was almost twice as high in urban than in nonurban areas. The national fatal overdose rate was stable over the period 2005 to 2014 and increased monotonically to a peak in 2021. Fatal overdose rates varied across cities. Cities with the 8 highest fatal overdose rates in the period were all in states along the US-Mexico border. Conclusions. Fatal overdoses have doubled over the past 15 years in Mexico. Overdose rates are particularly high and increasing in cities close to the US-Mexico border. Public Health Implications. There is a need for enhanced overdose surveillance data and coordinated harm reduction strategies, particularly in the northern border region of Mexico.

We examine lessons learned from the first decade (2012-2022) of the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, a cornerstone in the VA continuum of homeless services aimed at both preventing homelessness among those at risk and providing rapid rehousing for veterans and their families who are currently experiencing homelessness. Drawing on information from annual reports and other relevant literature, we have identified 3 themes of SSVF that emerged as features to comprehensively deliver support for homeless veterans and their families: (1) responsiveness and flexibility, (2) coordination and integration, and (3) social resource engagement. Using these strategies, SSVF reached nearly three quarters of a million veterans and their families in its first decade, thereby becoming one of the VA#QUOTE#s most substantial programmatic efforts designed to address homelessness. We discuss how each feature might apply to addressing homelessness in the general population as well as future research directions.
